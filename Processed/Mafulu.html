<h2 class="main">Preface</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This book is the outcome of an expedition to British
New Guinea in 1910, in which, after a short stay among the people of
some of the western Solomon Islands, including those of that old centre
of the head hunters, the Rubiana lagoon, and a preparatory and
instructive journey in New Guinea among the large villages of the Mekeo
district, I struck across country by a little known route, via Lapeka,
to Ido-Ido and on to Dilava, and thus passed by way of further
preparation through the Kuni country, and ultimately reached the
district of the Mafulu villages, of whose people very little was known,
and which was therefore the mecca of my pilgrimage.</p>
<p>I endeavoured to carry out the enquiries of which the book is a
record as carefully and accurately as possible; but it must be
remembered that the Mafulu people had seen very few white men, except
some of the Fathers of the Catholic Mission of the Sacred Heart, the
visits of Government officials and once or twice of a scientific
traveller having been but few and far between, and only short; that the
mission station <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e151" href=
"#xd26e151" name="xd26e151">vi</a>]</span>in Mafulu (the remotest
station of the mission) had only been established five years
previously; that the people were utterly unaccustomed to the type of
questioning which systematic ethnological enquiry involves, and that
necessarily there was often the usual hesitation in giving the required
information.</p>
<p>I cannot doubt, therefore, that future enquiries and investigations
made in the same district will bring to light errors and
misunderstandings, which even with the greatest care can hardly be
avoided in the case of a first attempt on new ground, where everything
has to be investigated and worked up from the beginning. I hope,
however, that the bulk of my notes will be found to have been correct
in substance so far as they go.</p>
<p>I regret that my ignorance of tropical flora and fauna has made it
impossible for me to give the names of many of the plants and animals
to which I refer.</p>
<p>There are many people, more than I can mention here, to whom I owe
my grateful thanks. Prior to my departure for the South Seas Dr. Haddon
took great trouble in helping and advising me, and, indeed, I doubt
whether I should have ventured upon my solitary expedition if I had not
had his stimulating encouragement.</p>
<p>In New Guinea I had the never-failing hospitality and kindness of my
good friend Monseigneur de Boismenu (the Bishop of the Mission of the
Sacred Heart) and the Fathers and Brothers of the Mission. Among the
latter I would specially mention Father Egedi and Father Clauser.
Father Egedi (whose name is already familiar to students of New Guinea
Ethnology) was my friend and travelling companion during a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e161" href="#xd26e161" name=
"xd26e161">vii</a>]</span>portion of my journeyings through the Mekeo
and Kuni districts, and his Mekeo explanations proved invaluable to me
when I reached my Mafulu destination. And dear good Father Clauser was
a pillar of help in Mafulu. He placed at my disposal all his existing
knowledge concerning the people, and was my intermediary and
interpreter throughout all my enquiries. And finally, when having at
some risk prolonged my stay at Mafulu until those enquiries were
completed, I was at last compelled by the serious state of my health to
beat a retreat, and be carried down to the coast, he undertook to do
the whole of my photographing and physical measurements, and the care
and skill with which he did so are evidenced by the results as
disclosed in this book.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e163src" href=
"#xd26e163" name="xd26e163src">1</a> I must also add that the <a href=
"#p000">frontispiece</a> and plates <a href="#p017">17</a>, <a href=
"#p067">67</a>, <a href="#p068">68</a>, <a href="#p069">69</a> and
<a href="#p070">70</a> are taken from previous photographs which Father
Clauser kindly placed at my disposal. My remembrance of His Lordship
the Bishop, and of the Reverend Fathers and the Brothers of the Mission
will ever be one of affectionate personal regard, and of admiration of
the spirit of heroic self-sacrifice which impels them to submit
cheerfully to the grave and constant hardships and dangers to which
their labour of love necessarily exposes them.</p>
<p>Since my return home Dr. Seligmann has given me immense help,
advising me upon my notes, placing material at my disposal, and
afterwards reading through a considerable portion of my manuscript. Mr.
T.&nbsp;A. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e187" href="#xd26e187"
name="xd26e187">viii</a>]</span>Joyce and Mr. J. Edge Partington helped
me in arranging and dealing with the things which I had brought back to
the British Museum. Dr. Keith examined and reported upon some skulls
which I had obtained, and advised me upon my notes on physique. Dr.
Stapf helped me in matters of botanical identification; Mr. S.&nbsp;H.
Ray has given me the full benefit of his wide knowledge of South
Pacific linguistics, and has written the appendices to the book. And,
finally, Dr. Haddon has very kindly read through my proof sheets.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would add that there is still an immense amount of
detailed work to be done among the Mafulu people, and that the
districts of the Ambo and Boboi and Oru Lopiku people, still further
back among the mountains, offer an almost virgin field for
investigation to anyone who will take the trouble to go there.

<p class="byline">By Dr. A.&nbsp;C. Haddon</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is a great pleasure to me to introduce Mr.
Williamson&rsquo;s book to the notice of ethnologists and the general
public, as I am convinced that it will be read with interest and
profit.</p>
<p>Perhaps I may be permitted in this place to make a few personal
remarks. Mr. Williamson was formerly a solicitor, and always had a
great longing to see something of savage life, but it was not till
about four years ago that he saw his way to attempting the realisation
of this desire by an expedition to Melanesia. He made my acquaintance
in the summer of 1908, and seeing that he was so keenly interested, I
lent him a number of books and all my <abbr title=
"manuscript">MS.</abbr> notes on Melanesia; by the help of these and by
the study of other books he gained a good knowledge of the ethnology of
that area. In November, 1908, he started for Oceania for the first time
and reached Fiji, from which place he had intended to start on his
expedition. Circumstances over which he had no control, however,
prevented the carrying out of his original programme; so he went to
Sydney, and there arranged modified plans. He was on the point of
executing these, when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1100" href=
"#xd26e1100" name="xd26e1100">xviii</a>]</span>he was again frustrated
by a telegram from England which necessitated his immediate return. It
was a sad blow to him to have his long-cherished schemes thus thwarted
and rendered abortive, but, undaunted, he set about to plan another
expedition. Accordingly, in January, 1910, he once more set sail for
Australia as a starting place for the Solomon Islands and British New
Guinea, and this time achieved success; the book which he now offers to
the public is the result of this plucky enterprise. In justice to the
author it should be known that, owing to climatic and other conditions,
he was unwell during the whole of his time in New Guinea, and had an
injured foot and leg that hurt him every step he took. The only wonder
is that he was able to accomplish so large and so thorough a piece of
work as he has done.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note the different ways by which various
investigators have entered the field of Ethnology. Some have approached
it from the literary or classical side, but very few indeed of these
have ever had any experience in the field. The majority of field
workers have had a previous training in science&mdash;zoology not
unnaturally has sent more recruits than any other branch of science. A
few students have been lawyers, but so far as I am aware Mr. Williamson
is the first British lawyer who has gone into the field, and he has
proved that legal training may be a very good preliminary discipline
for ethnological investigation in the field, as it gives invaluable
practice in the best methods of acquiring and sifting of evidence. A
lawyer must also necessarily have a wide knowledge of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1104" href="#xd26e1104" name=
"xd26e1104">xix</a>]</span>human nature and an appreciation of varied
ways of thought and action.</p>
<p>It was with such an equipment and fortified by extensive reading in
Ethnology, that Mr. Williamson was prepared for his self-imposed task.
Proof of his powers of observation will be found in the excellent
descriptions of objects of material culture with which he has presented
us.</p>
<p>I now turn to some of the scientific aspects of his book. Mr.
Williamson especially set before himself the work of investigating some
tribes in the mountainous hinterland of the Mekeo district. This was a
most happy selection, though no one could have foreseen the especial
interest of these people.</p>
<p>Thanks mainly to the systematic investigations of Dr. Seligmann and
to the sporadic observations of missionaries, government officials and
travellers, we have a good general knowledge of many of the peoples of
the eastern coast of the south-eastern peninsula of New Guinea, and of
some of the islands from the Trobriands to the Louisiades. The
Ethnology of the fertile and populous Mekeo district has been mainly
made known to us by the investigations of various members of the Sacred
Heart Mission, and by Dr. Seligmann. What little we know of the Papuan
Gulf district is due to missionaries among the coastal tribes, Mr.
James Chalmers and Mr. W. Holmes. Dr. G. Landtman is at present
investigating the natives of the delta of the Fly river and Daudai. The
natives of the Torres Straits islands have also been studied as fully
as is possible. But of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1112"
href="#xd26e1112" name="xd26e1112">xx</a>]</span>mountain region lying
behind the Mekeo district very little indeed has been published; so Mr.
Williamson&rsquo;s book fills a gap in our knowledge of Papuan
ethnology.</p>
<p>We have as yet a very imperfect knowledge of the ethnological
history of New Guinea. Speaking very broadly, it is generally admitted
that the bulk of the population belongs to the Papuan race, a
dark-skinned, woolly-haired people who have also spread over western
Oceania; but, to a greater or less extent, New Guinea has been subject
to cultural and racial influences from all sides, except from
Australia, where the movement has been the other way. Thus the East
Indian archipelago has directly affected parts of Netherlands New
Guinea, and its influence is to be traced to a variable degree in
localities in the Bismarck archipelago, German New Guinea (Kaiser
Wilhelm&rsquo;s Land), Western Oceania, and British New Guinea or
Papua, as it is termed officially.</p>
<p>The south-eastern peninsula of New Guinea&mdash;or at all events the
coastal regions&mdash;has been largely affected by immigrants, who were
themselves a mixed people, and who came later at various times. It is
to these immigrants that Mr. Ray and I applied the term Melanesian
(Ray, S.&nbsp;H., and Haddon, A.&nbsp;C., &ldquo;A Study of the
Languages of Torres Straits,&rdquo; <i>Proc. Roy. Irish Acad.</i>, 3rd
ser., IV., 1897, p. 509). Early in 1894, Mr. Ray read a paper before
the Anthropological Institute (<i>Journ. Anth. Inst.</i>, XXIV., p.
15), in which he adhered to our former discrimination of two linguistic
stocks and added a third type of language composed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1124" href="#xd26e1124" name=
"xd26e1124">xxi</a>]</span>of a mixture of the other two, for which he
proposed the name Melano-Papuan. These languages, according to Mr. Ray,
occur in the Trobriands, Woodlarks and the Louisiades, and similar
languages are found in the northern Solomon Islands. For some years I
had been studying the decorative art of British New Guinea, and from
physical and artistic and other cultural reasons had come to the
conclusion that the Melanesians of British New Guinea should be broken
up into two elements: one consisting of the Motu and allied
Melanesians, and the other of the inhabitants of the Massim
district&mdash;an area extending slightly beyond that of Mr.
Ray&rsquo;s Melano-Papuans (&ldquo;The Decorative Art of British New
Guinea,&rdquo; <i>Cunningham Memoirs</i>, X., <i>Roy. Irish Acad.</i>,
1894, pp. 253&ndash;269). I reinforced my position six years later
(&ldquo;Studies in the Anthropo-geography of British New Guinea,&rdquo;
<i>Journ. Roy. Geog. Soc.</i>, 1900, pp. 265, 414). Dr. Seligmann, in
his valuable paper &ldquo;A Classification of the Natives of British
New Guinea&rdquo; (<i>Journ. Roy. Anth. Inst.</i>, XXXIX., 1909, pp.
246, 315) corroborated these views and designated the two groups of
&ldquo;Melanesians&rdquo; as the Eastern and Western Papuo-Melanesians.
The following year he published the great book to which Mr. Williamson
so frequently refers, and in which this classification is maintained,
and these two groups together with the Papuans, are termed
Papuasians.</p>
<p>The Motu stock of the Western Papuo-Melanesians have extended their
dispersal as far as the Mekeo district, where they came into contact
with other peoples. It has been shown that the true Papuans are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1141" href="#xd26e1141" name=
"xd26e1141">xxii</a>]</span>a narrow-headed people, but there are some
puzzling exceptions, the explanation of which is not yet ascertained.
The Papuo-Melanesians contain a somewhat broad-headed element, and
there is a slightly broad-headed population in the central range of the
south-east peninsula, the extent of which has not yet been determined.
The questions naturally arise: (1) Is the true Papuan a variable stock
including both long- broad-headed elements? or (2) Does the
broad-headed element belong to an immigrant people? or, again (3) Is
there an hitherto unidentified indigenous broad-headed race? I doubt if
the time is ripe for a definite answer to any of these questions.
Furthermore, we have yet to assign to their original sources the
differences in culture which characterise various groups of people in
New Guinea. Something has been done in this direction, but much more
has yet to be learnt.</p>
<p>So far I have not referred to a Negrito element in the Ethnology of
New Guinea. From time to time we have heard rumours of pygmy people,
and German travellers have recorded very short individuals in Kaiser
Wilhelm&rsquo;s Land; but it was not till the expedition to Netherlands
New Guinea of the British Ornithological Union of 1910&ndash;11 that a
definite pygmy race was demonstrated. I think this can be no longer
denied, and the observations made by German ethnologists show that the
race in a more or less modified state is widely spread. Now Mr.
Williamson, whose work in New Guinea was contemporaneous with that of
the Netherlands New Guinea expedition, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1146" href="#xd26e1146" name="xd26e1146">xxiii</a>]</span>adduces
evidence that this is also the case in British territory. It is worth
recalling that de Quatrefages and Hamy (<i>Crania Ethnica</i>, 1882,
pp. 207&ndash;210, 253&ndash;256) distinguish a
&ldquo;Negrito-Papuan&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Papuan&rdquo; element in the
Torres Straits. This problem will be discussed in Vol. I. of the
Reports of the Cambridge Expedition to Torres Straits. I feel little
doubt that Mr. Williamson has shown strong evidence that the Mafulu and
probably other adjacent mountain tribes are essentially a
pygmy&mdash;that is to say a Negrito&mdash;people who have been
modified to some extent by Papuan and possibly Papuo-Melanesian
influence, both physical and cultural. He has marshalled his data with
great skill, and has dissected out, as it were, the physical and
cultural elements of the Negrito substratum. It only remains for other
observers to study Negritos in other parts of New Guinea to see how far
these claims can be substantiated. It is evident therefore that, apart
from the valuable detailed information which Mr. Williamson has given
us concerning a hitherto unknown tribe, he has opened up a problem of
considerable interest and magnitude.</p>

<p class="first">The <a href="#map">map</a> appended to this volume is
(with the exception of the red lines and red lettering upon it) a
reproduction of a portion of the map relating to the explorations and
surveys of Dr. Strong, Mr. Monckton and Captain Barton, which was
published in the <i>Geographical Journal</i> for September, 1908, and
the use of which has been kindly permitted me by the Royal Geographical
Society. I have eliminated the red route lines which appear in the
original map, so as to avoid confusion with the red lines which I have
added. The unbroken red lines and the red lettering upon my map are
copied from a map, also kindly placed at my disposal, which has been
recently prepared by Father Fillodean of the Mission of the Sacred
Heart, and these lines mark roughly what the Fathers of the Mission
believe to be the boundaries of the several linguistic areas within the
district covered by their map. It will be observed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1168" href="#xd26e1168" name=
"xd26e1168">2</a>]</span>that some of these lines are not continued so
as to surround and complete the definition of the areas which they
indicate; but this defect is unavoidable, as the Fathers&rsquo; map
only covered a relatively small area, and even in that map the lines
were not all carried to its margin. It will also be noticed that,
though the Fathers introduce the two names Oru Lopiku and Boboi as
being linguistically distinct, they have not indicated the boundary
line between the two areas. Father Egedi, however, informed me that
this boundary passes along the ridge of hills south of the Ufafa river
as far as Mt. Eleia, and thence along the Ukalama river to the Kuni
boundary. The Ukalama river is not shown in the Geographical
Society&rsquo;s map; but I may say that it is shown in the
Fathers&rsquo; map as rising in Mt. Eleia, and flowing thence in a
south-easterly direction, and so joining the St. Joseph river close to
Dilava. The broken red line upon my map does not appear in the
Fathers&rsquo; map, but has been added by me to indicate what, I
understand, the Fathers believe to be a continued boundary, so far as
ascertained, of the Fuyuge linguistic area, called by them the Mafulu
area, to which I am about to draw attention.</p>
<p>The term Mafulu is the Kuni pronunciation of Mambule, which is the
name, as used by themselves, of the people who live in a group of
villages within and near the north-westerly corner of the area of the
Fuyuge-speaking people, whose Papuan language, so far as ascertained,
appears, subject to local dialectal differences, to be the same, and
may, I was informed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1172" href=
"#xd26e1172" name="xd26e1172">3</a>]</span>be regarded as one common
language throughout the Fuyuge area.</p>
<p>The Fathers of the Mission have adopted the name Mafulu in a wider
sense, as including all the people with whom they have come in contact
of the Fuyuge-speaking area; and, though my investigations, which form
the subject-matter of this book, have been conducted only in the
neighbourhood of Mafulu itself, I was assured that, so far as the
Fathers have been able to ascertain, all these Fuyuge people not only
have similar languages, but also are substantially similar in physique
and in culture. My observations concerning the Mafulu people may
therefore, if this statement is correct, be regarded as applying, not
only to the inhabitants of the portion of the north-westerly corner of
the Fuyuge area in which the Mafulu group of villages is placed, but to
those of the whole of the north-westerly portion of the area, and
generally in a greater or less degree of accuracy to those of the
northerly and north-easterly parts of the area, and possibly the
southerly ones also.</p>
<p>The boundaries of this Fuyuge-speaking area can hardly be regarded
as definitely ascertained; and the discrepancies, even as regards the
courses of the rivers and the positions of the mountains, which appear
in the few available maps make it difficult to deal with the question.
The area, so far as actually ascertained by the Fathers of the Mission,
roughly speaking, covers, and seems to extend also some distance to the
south or south-west of a triangle, the western apex of which is the
junction of the river Kea with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1178" href="#xd26e1178" name="xd26e1178">4</a>]</span>river
Aduala (a tributary of the St. Joseph),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1180src" href="#xd26e1180" name="xd26e1180src">1</a> whose
north-eastern apex is Mt. Albert Edward, and whose south-eastern apex
is Mt. Scratchley. It includes the valley of the Aduala river and its
streams (except those flowing into it from the north in the region of
the western apex of the triangle) within its northern boundary, and the
valley of the upper Vanapa river and its rivers and streams in the
neighbourhood of its eastern boundary; but this eastern boundary has
been found to extend also so as to include the upper valley of the
river Chirima. How far the area extends to the south or south-west of
the triangle above mentioned appears to be uncertain.</p>
<p>The linguistic area to the north of the Mafulu or Fuyuge people is
that of the Ambo people, who are somewhat similar in appearance to the
Mafulu, and whose language is also Papuan, and, though differing from
the Mafulu language, is, I was told, somewhat similar to it in
grammatical construction and as regards a few of its words. The area to
the west is that of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1188" href=
"#xd26e1188" name="xd26e1188">5</a>]</span>Kuni people, whose language
is Melanesian, but whose ordinary modes of life are, I was informed,
more like those of the Mafulu than are those of the Papuan-speaking
Ambo. The areas to the east and south cannot be so definitely stated,
but are dealt with below.</p>
<p>As regards these Ambo people I may, in view of divergences of names
which appear in maps, explain that Ambo is a contraction of Ambore, and
is the name given to the people by their Mafulu neighbours, whilst Afoa
is the name given to them by the Kuni people, and is adopted in the
Geographical Society&rsquo;s map.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1192src"
href="#xd26e1192" name="xd26e1192src">2</a> As regards the Kuni people,
their name is the one adopted by themselves.</p>
<p>Concerning the boundaries of the Fuyuge linguistic area as above
indicated, and the people whose districts adjoin that area, I propose
here to draw attention to four names, and to refer to some observations
bearing on the subject of the probable Fuyuge boundary which are to be
found in existing literature.</p>
<p>The term Kovio, though primarily the name of Mt. Yule, and properly
applicable to the people living in the neighbourhood of that mountain,
is now, I think, often used to express all the mountain tribes of the
hinterland of the Mekeo and Pokau, and perhaps the Kabadi, districts.
But the use of this name has not, I believe, been generally associated
with any question of linguistics.</p>
<p>The area in the map which is called by the Fathers <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1213" href="#xd26e1213" name=
"xd26e1213">6</a>]</span>Boboi is occupied by people whose language, I
was told by the Fathers, is Papuan, but is distinct from the languages
of the Ambo and the Fuyuge areas.</p>
<p>Kamaweka is a name which appears in several of Dr. Seligmann&rsquo;s
publications. It seems to have been originally used by Captain Barton
to designate the natives of the district of which Inavaurene, to the
north-east of the Mekeo plains, is the centre, but to have been
afterwards regarded as a somewhat more general term; and I think Dr.
Seligmann uses it in a very general sense, almost, if not quite,
equivalent to the wide application above referred to of the term Kovio,
and which might include the Papuan-speaking Boboi and Ambo people, and
even perhaps the people of the northern Mafulu villages.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1218src" href="#xd26e1218" name="xd26e1218src">3</a>
But here again the use of the name has, I think, no reference to
linguistics.</p>
<p>If the Fathers&rsquo; linguistic boundary lines are substantially
correct, each of the two terms Kovio and Kamaweka, as now used, would
appear to cover more than one linguistic area; and in any case these
terms seem to have widened and to have become somewhat indefinite. It
will be seen on reference to the map and to Father Egedi&rsquo;s
information as to the Oru Lopiku and Boboi boundaries that both Mt.
Yule and Inavaurene are within the area which the Fathers call Oru
Lopiku, but that Inavaurene is not far from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1232" href="#xd26e1232" name=
"xd26e1232">7</a>]</span>their Boboi area. I suggest that it would be
convenient for the present, pending further investigation and
delimitation on the spot, and until we know something of the difference
between the languages of the Oru Lopiku and Boboi people, to adopt the
term Kovio as a general name for, and confine it to, the two areas
Boboi and Oru Lopiku; though for linguistic purposes the names Boboi
and Oru Lopiku, which at present indicate very little to us, may
eventually be accepted and come into general use.</p>
<p>The Koiari people of the foothills and lateral spurs behind the Motu
area, also referred to from time to time in Dr. Seligmann&rsquo;s
writings, must be eastern next door neighbours of the Fuyuge-speaking
people, the western boundary of these Koiari being stated by him to be
the Vanapa river,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1236src" href="#xd26e1236"
name="xd26e1236src">4</a> and they being in fact regarded by him as
being the eastern neighbours of the natives of &ldquo;the mountains
inland of Mekeo Nara and Kabadi,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1241src" href="#xd26e1241" name="xd26e1241src">5</a> and being
referred to by him as being the people from whose district the Kamaweka
and Kuni are reached by &ldquo;passing westward&rdquo;&mdash;the word
used is &ldquo;eastward,&rdquo; but this is obviously a printer&rsquo;s
error&mdash;&ldquo;in the mountains, keeping roughly parallel with the
coast.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1246src" href="#xd26e1246"
name="xd26e1246src">6</a></p>
<p>Turning to the question of the Fuyuge boundary, Dr. Strong says that
the Fuyuge people occupy the upper waters of the St. Joseph
river,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1253src" href="#xd26e1253" name=
"xd26e1253src">7</a> and he is quoted by Dr. Seligmann as having stated
that the Afoa <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1258" href=
"#xd26e1258" name="xd26e1258">8</a>]</span>language &ldquo;is spoken in
the villages on Mt. Pizoko and the northern slopes of Mt.
Davidson,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the Afoa villages lie to the north of
the Fuyuge-speaking communities, stretching westward for an unknown
distance behind Mt. Davidson.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1260src" href="#xd26e1260" name="xd26e1260src">8</a> If the
information given to me verbally by the Fathers of the Mission of the
Sacred Heart and the red linguistic boundary lines roughly drawn by
them, and introduced into my map, be correct, these statements require
modification, for according to the Fathers the Mafulu or
Fuyuge-speaking area does not include any part of the St. Joseph river,
as its extreme north-westerly corner lies to the east of the
junction&mdash;close to the boundary line between the Afoa (Ambo) and
the Kuni areas&mdash;of the rivers Alabula and Aduala, and Mt. Pizoko
is within the Fuyuge area, and not within that of the Afoa, and Mt.
Davidson is within the Boboi area. I think that, though the
Fathers&rsquo; lines are admittedly not exact, they and the information
supplied by the Fathers to me are likely to be more trustworthy in
these respects, especially as regards boundaries near to the actual
Mafulu villages, than the earlier statements of Dr. Strong, as they are
the outcome of recent and careful investigation; and, as regards Mt.
Pizoko, I may mention that Dr. Strong himself seems to have
subsequently regarded that mountain as being within the Mafulu
district,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1265src" href="#xd26e1265" name=
"xd26e1265src">9</a> which brings it into the Fuyuge area.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the upper valley of the river <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1273" href="#xd26e1273" name=
"xd26e1273">9</a>]</span>Chirima within the Fuyuge or Mafulu-speaking
area is perhaps surprising, as this valley is separated from the
general Fuyuge area by one of the southern ridges of Mt. Albert Edward,
and more or less so by the ridges of Mt. Stone Wigg and the Wharton
range, and as the Chirima is a tributary flowing into the Mambare
river, which is one of the great watercourses of Northern New Guinea.
The Mafulu Fathers, however, had no doubt as to the correctness of the
inclusion, which seems to open out the possibility of some, at all
events, of the Fuyuge people having northern associations; and indeed
Monseigneur de Boismenu told me that he believed that the Mafulu people
were in touch with Northern New Guinea, and got some of their shell
ornaments, or the shells from which they were made, from the northern
coast.</p>
<p>It is interesting, therefore, to turn for the purpose of comparison
to the report of Mr. Monckton&rsquo;s expedition to Mt. Albert Edward
by way of the Upper Chirima valley in 1906<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1277src" href="#xd26e1277" name="xd26e1277src">10</a> and the
illustrations accompanying it, with which I incorporate a description
of the people of this valley given to Dr. Seligmann by Mr. Money, who
was with Mr. Monckton.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1283src" href=
"#xd26e1283" name="xd26e1283src">11</a></p>
<p>From these it appears that the Upper Chirima people are short in
stature and sturdily built. Both sexes wear the perineal band, the
front of which is made (I am not sure whether this applies to women as
well as to men) to bulge out by padding. In some cases the men&rsquo;s
hair is tied up in a bunch with string, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e1290" href="#xd26e1290" name="xd26e1290">10</a>]</span>and in
others it is bound up in various styles with native cloth. Some of the
men have their hair done up in small plaits over the forehead. All the
above descriptions, except that of the padding of the band, are
applicable to the Mafulu. Some of the Chirima houses have a curious
apse-like roof projection over the front platform, which is a specially
distinctive feature of a Mafulu house, and one with this projection
figured by Mr. Monckton is indistinguishable from a typical Mafulu
house. The Chirima people place the bodies of their dead on raised
platforms, and apparently sometimes put the body of an infant on the
platform erection of an adult, but below the latter. This also is a
practice of the Mafulu; and, though the latter people confine platform
burial (if such it may be called) to chiefs and their families and
important persons, it is possible that some such limitation of the
custom exists in the Chirima valley also, but did not come under Mr.
Monckton&rsquo;s notice. A burial platform figured by him might well be
a Mafulu burial platform, except that the curious cone-shaped
receptacle for the child is a form for which I cannot vouch as regards
the Mafulu. The Chirima have a special and peculiar form of netting,
which Mr. Monckton&rsquo;s illustration shows to be identical with the
special form of Mafulu netting. On the other hand, as regards the
Chirima weapons, implements and utensils, a comparison of Mr.
Monckton&rsquo;s verbal descriptions and figures with what I have seen
in Mafulu, and describe in this book, leads me to the conclusion that,
though many of these are similar to those of Mafulu, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1292" href="#xd26e1292" name=
"xd26e1292">11</a>]</span>some of them are different. As examples of
this I may say that the drill implements of the Chirima people are very
similar to, and their stone cloth-beaters appear to be identical with,
those used by the Mafulu; whilst on the other hand their war bows are
much longer,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1294src" href="#xd26e1294"
name="xd26e1294src">12</a> and their method of producing fire seems to
be totally different; also they apparently have bull-roarers, which to
the best of my knowledge are unknown among the Mafulu. Again some of
the Chirima weapons, as figured by Mr. Monckton, disclose ideas of
artistic design, including that of the curved line and a rude
representation of a man, which I have not met with among the Mafulu. As
regards this last point I draw attention to Mr. Monckton&rsquo;s
figures of carving on a bow and on wooden clubs. I think, however, that
in such matters as these local differences might well arise between
people who are really more or less identical, especially if their
respective districts are on opposite sides of the main mountain range
of the country, and still more so if the people of one of the districts
(in the present case I refer to the Chirima people) may perhaps have
been subject to the influence of other people beyond them. As to this
latter point, however, I should say that these Chirima people seem to
be, so far as dress, ornaments, &amp;c., are concerned, much nearer to
the Mafulu than they are to the natives of the Mambare river itself, as
described by Sir William Macgregor.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1300src"
href="#xd26e1300" name="xd26e1300src">13</a> It is curious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1305" href="#xd26e1305" name=
"xd26e1305">12</a>]</span>also that the dogs of the Chirima people are
not yellow dingoes, but are black and white, as is the case in
Mafulu.</p>
<p>I notice that Dr. Seligmann suggests that these Chirima valley
people are related to the natives of the neighbourhood of Mt.
Yule,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1309src" href="#xd26e1309" name=
"xd26e1309src">14</a> a statement which, though probably intended
broadly, is in accord with the suggestion that they are connected with
the Mafulu-speaking people.</p>
<p>The natives of Mt. Scratchley (apparently the eastern or
south-eastern side), visited by Sir William Macgregor in 1896, appear
from his description of them<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1316src" href=
"#xd26e1316" name="xd26e1316src">15</a> to show a few points of
resemblance to the Mafulu people. In particular I refer to their
&ldquo;dark bronze&rdquo; colour, to the wearing by women of the
perineal band (to which, however, is added a mantle and &ldquo;in most
cases&rdquo; a grass petticoat, which is not done in Mafulu), to the
absence of tattooing or cicatrical ornamentation, to their &ldquo;large
earrings made out of tails of lizards covered by narrow straps of palm
leaves dyed yellow&rdquo; (which, though not correctly descriptive of
the Mafulu earring, is apparently something like it), to their use of
pigs&rsquo; tails as ear ornaments, to their plaiting of the hair and
the decoration of the plaited hair with teeth and shells, to their
small charm bags and to the shortness of their bows. Also to the
construction of their houses, with the roof carried down to the ground,
with a fireplace about <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1321" href=
"#xd26e1321" name="xd26e1321">13</a>]</span>2 feet wide extending down
the centre of the building from one end to the other, and having an
inclined floor on each side, and especially to the curious apse-like
roof projections in front of these houses (Dr. Haddon calls them
&ldquo;pent roofs&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1323src" href=
"#xd26e1323" name="xd26e1323src">16</a>), Sir William&rsquo;s figure of
which is, like that of the Chirima villages, identical, or nearly so,
with that of a Mafulu house. But Sir William&rsquo;s description of the
physique of these Mt. Scratchley people and other matters make it
clear, I think, that they belong to a type different from that of the
Mafulu, though they must be next door neighbours of the Fuyuge-speaking
people. Dr. Seligmann, in commenting upon this description of these
people, expresses the opinion that they are Papuo-Melanesians.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e1328src" href="#xd26e1328" name=
"xd26e1328src">17</a></p>
<p>The natives in the region of Mt. Musgrave and Mt. Knutsford, as
described by Mr. Thomson,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1335src" href=
"#xd26e1335" name="xd26e1335src">18</a> appear, at all events so far as
dress is concerned, to be utterly different from the Mafulu.</p>
<p>Dr. Seligmann states that Dr. Strong has informed him that the
southern boundary of the Fuyuge-speaking area is the Kabadi
country,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1342src" href="#xd26e1342" name=
"xd26e1342src">19</a> and he had previously referred to Korona,
immediately behind the Kabadi and Doura districts, as being within the
area,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1347src" href="#xd26e1347" name=
"xd26e1347src">20</a> and, indeed, the Geographical Society&rsquo;s map
shows the Fuyuge area as at all events extending as far south as
Korona. I do not know how far inland the Kabadi <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1352" href="#xd26e1352" name=
"xd26e1352">14</a>]</span>and Doura people extend; but I may say that
the Mafulu Fathers expressed grave doubt as to the extension of the
Fuyuge area so far south as is indicated by the map.</p>
<p>If the Fuyuge area does in fact reach the Kabadi boundary, and if my
notes on the Mafulu people are, as suggested, broadly descriptive of
the natives of the whole Fuyuge area, there must be a very sudden and
sharp differentiation, as the Kabadi people are apparently an offshoot
from Mekeo,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1357src" href="#xd26e1357" name=
"xd26e1357src">21</a> with apparently other Papuo-Melanesian blood
(especially Roro) introduced.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1363src" href=
"#xd26e1363" name="xd26e1363src">22</a></p>
<p>The contour and appearance of the country in the actual Mafulu
district of the Fuyuge area is strikingly different from that of the
immediately adjoining Kuni country, the sharp steep ridges and narrow
deep-cut valleys of the latter, with their thick unbroken covering of
almost impenetrable forest, changing to higher mountain ranges with
lateral ridges among them, and with frequent gentle undulating slopes
and wider and more open valleys; while, interspersed with the forests,
are small patches and great stretches of grass land, sometimes thinly
covered or scattered with timber and sometimes quite open and devoid of
trees.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1371src" href="#xd26e1371" name=
"xd26e1371src">23</a> And this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1380"
href="#xd26e1380" name="xd26e1380">15</a>]</span>condition continues, I
was told, over the greater part of the triangular area above referred
to.</p>
<p>Plates <a href="#p001">1</a> and <a href="#p002">2</a> give, I
think, a fair illustration of what I mean, the steep contours and
thickly wooded character of the foreground and nearer middle distance
shown by Plate <a href="#p001">1</a> being typical Kuni scenery, and
the more open nature of the country displayed by Plate <a href=
"#p002">2</a> and the comparative freedom from forest of its foreground
being typical of the higher uplands of Mafulu.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e1396src" href="#xd26e1396" name="xd26e1396src">24</a></p>
<p>It will be noticed that the physical character of the Mafulu country
is more favourable to continued occupation than is that of the Kuni
country; and it is a fact that the Mafulu people are not so restless
and ready to move as are the Kuni folk; and, even when they do migrate,
it is generally to a spot comparatively near to their old villages.</p>
<p>The geological formation of the lower hills on which the actual
Mafulu villages are placed and the intervening valleys is partly
limestone; and I was told that limestone formation was also found
further to the east.</p>
<p>Throughout this book I shall use the term &ldquo;Mafulu&rdquo; as
including, not only the little group of villages near the
north-westerly corner of the Fuyuge linguistic area actually known by
that name, but also the other groups of Fuyuge villages in the
north-western <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1408" href=
"#xd26e1408" name="xd26e1408">16</a>]</span>portion of that area; and,
as above indicated, it is believed by the Fathers of the Mission that I
should be substantially correct if I included the whole of the northern
and north-eastern, and probably the southern portions of the known part
of that area, and possibly the entire area. <span class=

Geographical Society&rsquo;s map used by me is somewhat confusing as
regards the upper reaches of the St. Joseph or Angabunga river and the
rivers flowing into and forming it. The Fathers&rsquo; map makes the
St. Joseph river commence under that name at the confluence, at a point
a little to the west of 8&deg; 30&prime; S. Lat. and 147&deg; E. Long.,
of the river Alabula (called in one of its upper parts Loloipa),
flowing from the north, and the river Aduala, flowing from Mt. Albert
Edward in the north-east; and this arrangement, which is practically in
accord with a map appended to the British New Guinea <i>Annual
Report</i> for June, 1900, is, I think, probably the most suitable and
correct one. The Aduala is the river the upper part of which is in the
Geographical Society&rsquo;s map called Angabunga. The Fathers&rsquo;
map shows the river Kea flowing into the Aduala at a distance of about
two miles above the confluence of the latter with the Alabula; but,
according to the Report map, this distance is about 12
miles.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e1180src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p class="first">The Mafulu people are of short stature, though perhaps
a trifle taller than the Kuni.</p>
<p>They are as a rule fairly strong and muscular in build, the women in
particular having very strongly developed thighs; but, speaking
generally, their limbs are more slender, and their general development
is slighter, than is usually the case among the Roro and Mekeo
people.</p>
<p>They appear to be usually mesaticephalic, but to have a very marked
tendency to brachycephaly.</p>
<p>Their noses seemed to me to be generally strong, and of prominent
size, varying considerably in width of bridge, but usually having
rather widely distending nostrils; and sometimes the width of the nose
was equal to its length, or nearly so.</p>
<p>Referring to the above matters, the following are the results of
twenty measurements of Mafulu men. These were obtained from men of
upwards of six different communities or groups of villages, so as to
avoid the possible misleading character of measurements made in only
one village or group of villages, in which some family relationship
between the persons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1427" href=
"#xd26e1427" name="xd26e1427">18</a>]</span>measured might militate
against the true average character of the figures obtained.</p>

<p>There are a few points in connection with these figures to which I
would draw attention. The very short man (No. 20&mdash;height, 147 cm.)
has a cranial index of 75.1, on the border line between dolichocephaly
and mesaticephaly. He has also a short nose (4.6 cm.), and is one of
the two with the narrowest noses (3.8 <span class="corr" id="xd26e1944"
title="Source: c.m.">cm.</span>). The very tall man (No.
8&mdash;height, 163 cm.) has a long head (19.4 cm.), and the lowest
dolichocephalic cranial index of 72.7, and is one of two with the
longest noses (5.6 cm.). The other very tall man (No. 10&mdash;height,
163 cm.) has one of the two shortest heads (17.4 cm.), and the highest
brachycephalic cranial index of 84.8, and has a long nose (5.5 cm.) The
man (No. 2) whose nasal index is 100 has the mesaticephalic cranial
index of 78.3 (almost the average index). The other man (No. 4) whose
nasal index is 100 has a head of exactly the average length (18.5 cm.)
and the greatest breadth (15.4 cm.), and the brachycephalic cranial
index of 81.2. The man (No. 17) with the lowest nasal index of 71.4 has
a very short head (17.7 cm.), and the brachycephalic cranial index of
82.2.</p>
<p>The following tables, however, illustrate the fact that the
measurements of these twenty men do not appear to indicate, as regards
them, any marked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e1949" href=

<p>It will be observed that the lowest of these three cranial indices
is a trifle higher than the lowest of those of the head measurements,
that the highest of them is much lower than the highest of those of the
head measurements, and that their average (76.8) is a little below the
average of those of the head measurements.</p>
<p>Dr. Keith had further measurements made of these <span class=

<p>Dr. Keith, referring to these skulls, says that they disclose
relatively small brains, the cranial capacity of A being 1,230 c.c.,
that of B being 1,330 c.c., and that of C being 1,130 c.c. He compares
these figures with the average cranial capacity of the male European,
which he puts at 1,500 c.c.</p>
<p>The eyes of the Mafulu people are dark brown and very bright. I
never saw among them those oblique eyes, almost recalling the
Mongolian, which, according to Dr. Seligmann, are found, though rarely
only, on the coast,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2110src" href=
"#xd26e2110" name="xd26e2110src">4</a> and of which I saw many
instances among the Kuni people.</p>
<p>Their lips are usually not so thick as are those of the Mekeo and
Roro people, and are generally finer and more delicate in shape.</p>
<p>In view of their Papuan language I kept a sharp look out for the
curious backward sloping foreheads and projecting brow ridges and
Jewish-looking noses which are so often found among the Western
Papuans; but, although I saw a few examples of these, they were rare,
and I did not observe any <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2119"
href="#xd26e2119" name="xd26e2119">22</a>]</span>noticeable tendency in
these directions in the faces of the people generally.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2121src" href="#xd26e2121" name=
"xd26e2121src">5</a></p>
<p>A curious characteristic with them is the big toe, which is usually
much developed, and projects outwards at a larger angle than is the
case with the Roro and Mekeo people, and is much used for holding on to
roots, &amp;c., whilst travelling along their rough mountain paths.</p>
<p>Their general colour is a dark sooty brown, a trifle darker,
perhaps, than that of the Kuni people, and contrasting forcibly with
the varying shades of chocolate which you find among the Roro and Mekeo
people. They are smooth-skinned.</p>
<p>Their hair is frizzly, and generally dark brown, often quite dark,
almost even approaching to black, and sometimes perhaps quite black.
But it is frequently lighter; and indeed I was often, when observing
men&rsquo;s hair lit up by sunshine, impressed by the fact that its
brown colour was not even what we should in Europe call dark.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2134src" href="#xd26e2134" name="xd26e2134src">6</a>
I often saw marked variations in the depth of hair colour on the head
of the same individual. I saw no examples of the comparatively straight
or curly type of hair which is found in the Pokau district and
elsewhere.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2140src" href="#xd26e2140" name=
"xd26e2140src">7</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2151" href=

<p>Plate <a href="#p003">3</a> gives front and side views of the
mesaticephalic (almost brachycephalic) skull A and Plate <a href=
"#p004">4</a> gives similar views of the dolichocephalic skull C. All
the photographs were made as nearly as possible exactly half the sizes
of the originals; but the photographer has made the front view of skull
A about an eighth of an inch too narrow (with, of course, a
corresponding deficiency in height), so that the tendency to roundness
of this skull is not quite sufficiently shown, and the proportion of
its height to its length is reduced, in the plate. I am not a
craniologist, and so I do not attempt to discuss the more detailed
points of interest which arise in connection with these skulls.</p>
<p>A good idea of the somewhat varying characters of the general
physiques and features of the people will be obtained from my plates;
but there are a few of these plates which I may mention here.</p>
<p>The people shown in Plates <a href="#p005">5</a>, <a href=
"#p006">6</a>, <a href="#p007">7</a>, <a href="#p008">8</a>, <a href=
"#p009">9</a> and <a href="#p016">16</a> may, I think, be regarded as
fairly typical, and I would draw attention to the somewhat Melanesian
tendency of feature which is disclosed by the faces of the man in Plate
<a href="#p006">6</a>, the young man in the middle in Plate <a href=
"#p007">7</a> and the fourth and sixth men from the left in Plate
<a href="#p009">9</a>; also to the great diversity shown in Plate
<a href="#p009">9</a>. The man shown in Plate <a href="#p010">10</a>,
with his thick and strong muscular <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2199" href="#xd26e2199" name=
"xd26e2199">24</a>]</span>development, is of a type which is
occasionally seen, but which is, I believe, unusual. The two men
figured in Plates <a href="#p011">11</a> and <a href="#p012">12</a>
are, I think, specially interesting. The one to the right, with his
somewhat backward sloping forehead, and slightly arched nose, shows a
distinct tendency towards the type of the Western Papuan, to which I
have already referred. The other one is in general shape of head and
appearance of features not unlike some of the dwarf people found by the
recent expedition into Dutch New Guinea (see the man to the left in
Plate <a href="#p004">4</a> of the page of illustrations in <i>The
Illustrated London News</i> for September 2, 1911), and indeed there is
almost an Australian tendency in his face. It is noticeable that he has
a beard and moustache, which is quite unusual among the Mafulu. A
somewhat similar type of face may be noticed in one or two of the other
plates.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is difficult to speak with any degree of
definiteness on this question. It must be borne in mind that the Mafulu
people have been very little in touch with white people, the
missionaries, who have only been there since 1905, and on rare
occasions a Government official or scientific traveller, being almost
the only white men whom the bulk of them have ever seen; and they have
been but slightly affected by the outside influences which for some
years past have been constantly brought to bear upon the natives of the
adjoining coast line and the people of the Mekeo plains; so that
comparisons of these people with their more up-to-date <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2218" href="#xd26e2218" name=
"xd26e2218">25</a>]</span>neighbours as regards their relative natural
characters may well be in some respects misleading.</p>
<p>Subject, however, to this caution I would say that they are lazy and
easy-going (though not so much so as the Roro and Mekeo people),
lively, excitable, cheerful, merry, fairly intelligent (this being
judged rather from the young people), very superstitious, brave, with
much power of enduring pain, cruel, not more revengeful perhaps than is
usual among uncivilised natives, friendly one with another, not
quarrelsome, but untrustworthy and not over-faithful even in their
dealings with one another, though honest as regards boundaries and
property rights and in the sense of not stealing from one another
within their own communities (this being regarded as a most shameful
offence), and of very loose sexual morality.</p>
<p>A difference between them and the Mekeo and Roro natives is that
they appear to be not so conservative as the latter, being more ready
to abandon old traditions and adopt new ideas; though this
characteristic is one which shows itself in the young people rather
than in the elders with their formed habits. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The perineal band, made of bark cloth, is the one
article of dress which is universally worn by both men and women.</p>
<p>These bands are made by both men and women, but are coloured by men
only. They are commonly unstained and undecorated; but some of them,
and especially those worn for visiting and at dances, are more or less
decorated. Some that I have noticed are stained in one colour covering
the whole garment; others in two colours arranged in alternate
transverse bands, sometimes with narrow spaces of unstained cloth
between; and again others have bands of one colour alternating with
bands of unstained cloth. Some are decorated with lines or groups of
lines of one colour, or alternating lines or groups of lines of two
colours, painted transversely across the cloth. Others, while simply
stained in one colour or stained or decorated in one of the ways above
described, have another simple terminal design near the end of the
garment.</p>
<p>The men&rsquo;s bands are usually small and narrow, as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2237" href="#xd26e2237" name=
"xd26e2237">27</a>]</span>compared with those worn by the Roro and
Mekeo people; and the women&rsquo;s bands seemed to me to be generally
even narrower than those of the men, particularly in front. Men&rsquo;s
bands, which I have measured, were about 6 inches wide at one end,
narrowing down to about 3 inches at the other; and the widths of
women&rsquo;s bands were 4 or 5 inches or less at one end, narrowing
down to about 2 inches at the other. But the bands of both men and
women, especially those of the latter, often become so crumpled up and
creased with wear that the portion passing between the legs dwindles
down to about an inch or less in width. One is tempted to think, as
regards both men and women, that, from the point of view of covering,
the bands might be dispensed with altogether. This remark applies still
more strongly to the case of young boys and unmarried girls, including
among the latter big full-grown girls, who are in fact fully developed
women, whose bands can hardly be regarded as being more than nominal,
and who, especially the girls and young women, and even sometimes
married women who are nursing their babies, can really only be
described as being practically naked.</p>
<p>Plate <a href="#p013">13</a> (Figs, 1, 2, and 3) illustrates the
staining and decoration of perineal bands.<a class="noteref" id=
"n27.1src" href="#n27.1" name="n27.1src">1</a> Fig. 1 is a section
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2247" href="#xd26e2247" name=
"xd26e2247">28</a>]</span>of a man&rsquo;s band about 6 inches wide.
The transverse lines, which extend along the whole length of the band,
are in alternate groups of black and red. The background is unevenly
stained yellow behind the black lines; but the background behind the
red lines and the spaces intervening between the groups of lines are
unstained. Fig. 2 is the pattern near the end of a woman&rsquo;s band
about 5 inches wide. The lines are coloured red. There is no pattern on
the rest of the band; but the whole of the band, including the
background of the pattern, is stained yellow. Fig. 3 is a section of a
woman&rsquo;s band about 2&frac12; inches wide. The colouring is in
alternate bands of red and yellow with irregular unstained spaces
between.</p>
<p>I was struck with the gradual reduction of the women&rsquo;s dress
as I travelled from the coast, with its Roro inhabitants, through
Mekeo, and thence by Lapeka and Ido-ido to Dilava, and on by Deva-deva
to Mafulu. The petticoats of the Roro women gave way to the shorter
ones of Mekeo, and these seemed to get shorter as I went further
inland. Then at Lapeka they were still shorter. At Ido-ido, which is
Kuni, the petticoats ceased, and there was only the perineal band.
Then, again, at Dilava (still Kuni) this band was narrower, and at
Deva-deva, and finally at Mafulu, it was often, as I have said, almost
nominal.</p>
<p>I was told that the age at which a boy usually begins to wear his
band is about 10 or 12, or in the case of a chief&rsquo;s son 16 or 17;
but that girls assume their bands at a somewhat earlier age, say at 7
or 8. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2253" href="#xd26e2253" name=
"xd26e2253">29</a>]</span>So far as my personal observation went I
should have thought that the usual maximum age of nakedness for both
boys and girls was rather younger, and I never saw a naked boy of an
age anything like 16.</p>
<p>The assumption of the perineal band is the subject of a ceremony
which will be dealt with hereafter.</p>
<p>Caps are very often worn by men, but not by women or children. These
are simply pieces of plain unstained bark cloth about 9 inches wide,
which are coiled and twisted on the head. The result is often a
shapeless mass; but there are methods of arranging the cloth in
definite ways which produce describable results. Sometimes the cloth is
merely coiled several times around the head, so as to produce a tall
thin turban-shaped band, the crown of the head being left uncovered.
Often this plan is extended by turning the end of the cloth over, so as
to cover the top of the head, thus producing in some cases a result
which resembles a fez, and in other cases one which looks more like a
tight skullcap. Again the cap often has its centre terminating in an
end or tassel hanging over, thus making it look like a cap of liberty;
and yet again I have seen the cap look almost like the square paper
caps often worn by certain artisans at home. These caps are seen in
several of the plates.</p>
<p>Abdominal belts are commonly worn by both men and women, but not as
a rule by children. There are several distinct forms of
these:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) A thick strong dark-coloured belt (Plate <a href="#p014">14</a>,
Fig. I) made of tree bark; made and worn by men only. The belt is about
3 or more inches wide and is often so <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2266" href="#xd26e2266" name="xd26e2266">30</a>]</span>long that
it passes twice round the body, the outer end being fastened to the
coil beneath it by two strings. This form of belt is sometimes
ornamented with simple straight-lined geometric patterns carved into
the belt, but it is never coloured. The process of manufacture is as
follows: they cut off a strip of bark large enough for one, two, three,
or four belts, and coil it up in concentric circles, like the two
circles of the belt when worn. They then place it so coiled into water,
and leave it there to soak for a few days, after which they strip off
the outer part, leaving the smooth inner bark, which they dry, and
finally cut into the required lengths, to which they add the attachment
strings made of native fibre.</p>
<p>(2) A belt made of a material looking like split cane and thin
strips from the fibre of what I was told was a creeping plant<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2271src" href="#xd26e2271" name=
"xd26e2271src">2</a>; made and worn by men only. The latter material is
obtained by splitting the fibre into thin strips. These strips and the
strips of split cane-like material are rather coarse in texture. The
former are of a dull red-brown colour (natural, not produced by
staining) and the latter are stone-yellow. The two are plaited together
in geometric patterns. The width of the belt is about 2 inches. It only
passes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2274" href="#xd26e2274" name=
"xd26e2274">31</a>]</span>once round the man&rsquo;s body; and the
plaiting is finished with the belt on the body, so that it can only
afterwards be removed by unplaiting or cutting it off.</p>
<p>(3) A belt (Plate <a href="#p014">14</a>, Fig. 2) made of
stone-yellow unsplit cane; made and worn by both men and women. This is
the simplest form of belt, being merely a strip of cane intertwined
(not plaited) so as to form a band about half an inch wide, and left
the natural colour of the cane. Both men and women, when short of food,
use this belt to reduce the pain of hunger, by tightening it over the
stomach. It is, therefore, much worn during a period of restricted diet
prior to a feast. Women also use it, along with their other ordinary
means, to bring about abortion, the belt being for this purpose drawn
very tightly round the body. Often two, or even three, such belts are
worn together.</p>
<p>(4) A belt (Plate <a href="#p014">14</a>, Fig. 3) made of coarse,
sometimes very coarse, stone-yellow split cane or cane-like material;
made and worn by men only. This belt is left the natural colour of the
material, which is plaited so as to form a band from half an inch to 2
inches broad, the two ends of which are bound together with cane. It
also, like No. 2, is finished on the body. A man will often wear two or
three of these belts together.</p>
<p>(5) A belt (Plate <a href="#p015">15</a>, Fig. i) made out of the
inner fibre of a creeping plant<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2291src"
href="#xd26e2291" name="xd26e2291src">3</a>; made and worn by men
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2294" href="#xd26e2294" name=
"xd26e2294">32</a>]</span>only. The fibre threads used for this belt
are very fine, so the plaiting is minute, instead of being coarse like
that of No. 2; but it is generally done rather loosely and openly. The
belt is usually about 2 inches wide or a trifle less and is often
plaited in slightly varying geometric patterns. It is not stained in
manufacture, but the natural stone-grey colour of the fibre soon
becomes tinted as the result of wear and the staining of the
wearer&rsquo;s body, and in particular it often becomes an ornamental
red. This belt also is finished on the man&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>(6) A belt (Plate <a href="#p015">15</a>, Fig. 2) made of the inner
fibre of what I was told was another creeping plant<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2301src" href="#xd26e2301" name="xd26e2301src">4</a> and the
stem of a plant which I believe to be one of the Dendrobiums<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2304src" href="#xd26e2304" name=
"xd26e2304src">5</a>; made and worn by men only. The fibres of the
former plant are stained black; the reedy stems of the other plant are
put in short bamboo stems filled with water, and then boiled. They are
then easily split up into flattish straws, and become a colour varying
from rather bright yellow to brown. For making the belt these two
materials, looking rather like black and bright yellow straw, are
plaited together in various geometrical patterns. The width of the belt
is 2 inches, or a trifle more. It is tied at the ends with fibre
string.</p>
<p>(7) A rather special form of belt (Plate <a href="#p015">15</a>,
Fig. 3) <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2312" href="#xd26e2312"
name="xd26e2312">33</a>]</span>used mainly for visiting and dancing;
made and worn by both men and women. The belt is made out of a hank of
loose separate strands between 4 and 5 feet long, tied together with
string or bark cloth at two opposite points, so as to form a belt of
between 2 feet and 2 feet 6 inches in length. For better description I
would liken it to a skein of wool, as it looks when held on the hands
of one person for the purpose of being wound off into a ball by someone
else, but which, instead of being wound off, is tied up at the two
points where it passes round the hands of the holder, and is then
pulled out into a straight line of double the original number of
strands, and so forms a single many-stranded belt of 2 feet or more in
length. It is fastened round the waist with a piece of bark cloth
attached to one of the points where the hank has been tied up.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2314src" href="#xd26e2314" name=
"xd26e2314src">6</a></p>
<p>The number of strands is considerable. Belts examined by me and
counted gave numbers varying from eighteen to thirty-five, and the
number of strands of the belt round the body would be double that. Each
strand is made of three parts plaited together, and is one-eighth of an
inch or less in width. Various materials, including all the materials
used for armlets (see below), are employed for making these belts,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2319" href="#xd26e2319" name=
"xd26e2319">34</a>]</span>some for one and some for another. Sometimes
a belt has its strands all plaited out of one material only, in which
case the belt will be all of one colour. Sometimes its strands are
plaited out of two different coloured materials. There is no colouring
of the belt, except that of its strands.</p>
<p>Belt No. 1, as worn, is seen in Plates <a href="#p009">9</a> and
<a href="#p011">11</a>. Belt No. 3 is worn by the man at the extreme
right in Plate <a href="#p016">16</a>. It is worn by many of the women
figured in the plates, and several of them have two belts. One of the
women figured in Plates <a href="#p018">18</a> and <a href=
"#p019">19</a> has three of them. Belt No. 4 is worn by one of the men
figured in Plates <a href="#p007">7</a> and <a href="#p008">8</a> (he
has three of them). Belt No. 7 is worn by one or two of the women
figured in the frontispiece, the one to the extreme right having a
many-stranded belt, and it is excellently illustrated in Plate <a href=
"#p017">17</a>.</p>
<p>Capes made of bark cloth are made and worn by men and women. They
are only put on after recovery from an illness by which the wearer has
been laid up, including childbirth. The cape is simply a plain long
narrow piece of undyed bark cloth. The corners of one end are fastened
together, and the whole of that end is bunched up into a sort of hood,
which is placed over the head, whilst the rest of the cloth hangs down
as a narrow strip behind. The cape in no way covers or conceals any
part of the body when viewed from the front or side. It is only worn
for a few days; but whilst wearing it the wearer discards all, or
nearly all, his or her ornaments. I could learn no reason for the
custom. Plates <a href="#p018">18</a> and <a href="#p019">19</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2356" href="#xd26e2356" name=
"xd26e2356">35</a>]</span>show these capes, and the way in which they
are worn.</p>
<p>Mourning strings (Plate <a href="#p030">30</a>, Fig. 1) are made and
worn by both men and women. These are plain undecorated necklaces
varying much in size and appearance; sometimes they are made of undyed
twisted bark cloth, and vary in thickness from one-sixteenth of an inch
to an inch; sometimes they are only made of string, and are quite thin.
There is always an end or tassel to the necklace, made out of the
extremities of the neck part, and hanging in front over the chest; and,
if the necklace is of string, and not of bark cloth, some bark cloth is
twisted round this tassel. This sign of grief is after a death worn by
the widow or widower or other nearest relative (male or female) of the
deceased; and at times two people of equal degree of relationship will
both wear it. It is worn until the formal ending of the mourning. The
woman to the extreme right in Plate <a href="#p026">26</a> is wearing
one of these.</p>
<p>Widows&rsquo; vests. These are mourning garments, only worn by the
widows of chiefs. The garment, which is made by women, is a vest made
of string network (like a string bag), the mesh of which is the special
Mafulu mesh, which will be described hereafter, and it is not coloured.
It is plainly and simply made, with openings at the top for the neck,
and at the sides for the arms (no sleeves), and coming down to about
the waist, without any other opening either in front or at the back.
This garment is also worn until the formal end of the period of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2368" href="#xd26e2368" name=
"xd26e2368">36</a>]</span>mourning.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2370src"
href="#xd26e2370" name="xd26e2370src">7</a> I was unable to secure a
picture of one of these.</p>
<p>There is no special dress for chiefs to distinguish them from other
people.</p>
<p>European calico clothing has not been adopted by these people, even
in the district where they are in touch with the missionaries. Indeed I
may say that the people, happily for their own health, show no
inclination to wear more clothing; and no doubt as a result of their
conservatism in this respect they escape many a fatal cold and attack
of pneumonia, and the spread of infectious skin diseases is somewhat
reduced. I may also add that the Bishop and Fathers of the Mission do
not attempt, or seem to desire, to urge the people who come under their
influence to endanger their health and their lives for the sake of
conforming to views as to clothing which have played such havoc with
tropical natives in many parts of the globe.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Tattooing and body-scarring are not practised by
either men or women among the Mafulu.</p>
<p>Depilation. When a young man&rsquo;s beard begins to grow, the hairs
of the beard and moustache and eye-brows <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2397" href="#xd26e2397" name="xd26e2397">37</a>]</span>are
extracted. No other depilation is practised by men, and none whatever
by women; and none of them shave any part of the body. The depilation
is effected with two fibre threads twisted round each other, the hair
to be extracted being inserted between the threads. Anyone can do this,
and there is no ceremony connected with it.</p>
<p>Nose-piercing. The septa of the noses of both men and women are
pierced at or after the age of 15 or 18, and either before or after
marriage. This is done for men by men, and for women by women. There is
no special person whose duty it is to do it, but he or she must be one
who knows the incantations which are required. There is no restriction
as to diet or otherwise placed upon the operator prior to the
operation, but there is a day&rsquo;s food restriction imposed upon the
person whose nose is to be pierced.</p>
<p>Two instruments are used for the operation, one being a piercing
instrument made of pig bone and sharpened, and the other being a small
wooden plug, also sharpened. The operator first visibly, but silently,
engages in two incantations, during the former of which he holds up the
thumb and first finger of his right hand, and during the latter of
which he holds up the two instruments. He then with the thumb and first
finger of his right hand holds the septum of the nose of the person to
be operated upon, whom I will call the &ldquo;patient,&rdquo; and with
the left hand pierces the septum with the bone instrument. He next
inserts the wooden plug into the hole, so as to make it larger, and
leaves the plug there. Then <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2403"
href="#xd26e2403" name="xd26e2403">38</a>]</span>he takes a blade of
grass, which he also inserts through the hole, by the side of the plug,
and, holding the grass by the two ends, he makes it rotate round and
round the plug. This is a painful process, which frequently causes
tears and cries from the patient. He then probably goes through the
same process with various other patients, as it is the custom to
operate on several persons at the same time.</p>
<p>The patients are then all lodged in houses built for the purpose,
one house being for men and one for women. These are not houses which
are kept permanently standing, but are specially built on each occasion
on which the nose-boring operation is going to be performed. A great
swelling of the patients&rsquo; noses develops, and this spreads more
or less over their faces. The patients are confined in the special
houses until the holes in their noses are large enough and the wounds
are healed. During this confinement each patient has himself to do what
is requisite to further enlarge the hole by the insertion into it from
time to time of pieces of wood and by putting in rolled up leaves and
pushing pieces of wood inside these leaves. During all this period he
is not allowed to come out of the house, at all events not so as to be
seen, and his diet is confined to sweet potato, cooked in a certain
way. The cooking for all the patients, men and women, is done by the
woman nose-piercing operator, assisted by other women. The potatoes are
wrapped up in leaves (usually banana), each potato being generally
wrapped up separately in one or more leaves; and, when so wrapped up,
they are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2407" href="#xd26e2407"
name="xd26e2407">39</a>]</span>cooked in red-hot ashes, and then taken
to the houses where the patients are.</p>
<p>When the hole in any patient&rsquo;s nose has reached the requisite
size, and the wound is healed, he inserts a large croton leaf<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2411src" href="#xd26e2411" name="xd26e2411src">9</a>
into the hole; he may then come out and return to his own house,
retaining the croton leaf in his nose. He must next occupy himself in
searching for a black non-poisonous snake about 12 or 18 inches long,
which is commonly found in the grass. I cannot say what snake this is,
but I am advised that it is probably <i lang="la-bio">Tropidonotus
mairii</i>. Its native name is <i lang="xx">fal&rsquo; ul&rsquo;
obe</i>, which means &ldquo;germ of the ground.&rdquo; Until he finds
this snake he must keep the croton leaf in his nose, and is still under
the same restriction as to food, which is cooked in the same way and by
the same persons as before. On finding the snake, he secures it alive,
removes the croton leaf from the hole in his nose, and inserts into it
the tail end of the living snake; then, holding the head of the snake
in one of his hands, and the tail in the other, he draws the snake
slowly through the hole, until its head is close to the hole. He then
lets the head drop from his hand, and with a quick movement of the
other hand draws it through the nose, and throws the snake, still
living, away.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2420src" href="#xd26e2420"
name="xd26e2420src">10</a> This <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2425" href="#xd26e2425" name="xd26e2425">40</a>]</span>completes
the nose-piercing; but there still rests upon the patient the duty of
going to the river, and there catching an eel, which he gives to the
people who have been feeding him during his illness.</p>
<p>The nose-piercing is generally done at one of the big feasts; and,
as these are rare in any one village, you usually find in the villages
many fully-grown people whose noses have not been pierced; though as to
this I may say that nose-piercing is more generally indulged in by
chiefs and important people and their families than by the village rank
and file. It commonly happens, however, that a good many people have to
be done when the occasion arises. Each person to be operated upon has
to provide a domestic pig for the big feast. I have been unable to
discover the origin and meaning of the nose-piercing ceremony.<a class=

<p>Ear-piercing is done to both men and women, generally when quite
young, say at seven or twelve years of age. Both the lower and the
upper lobes are pierced, sometimes only one or the other, and sometimes
both; but the lower lobe is the one more commonly pierced. They can do
it themselves, or can get someone else to do it. There is no ceremony.
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2440" href="#xd26e2440" name=
"xd26e2440">41</a>]</span>piercing is done with the thorn of a tree,
and the hole is afterwards gradually widened by the insertion of small
pieces of wood. They never make large holes, or enlarge them greatly
afterwards, as the holes are only used for the hanging of pendants, and
not for the insertion of discs. After the piercing the patient must,
until the wound is healed, abstain from all food except sweet potato;
but there is no restriction as to the way in which this food is to be
cooked, or the person who is to cook it. There is as regards
ear-piercing no difference between the case of chiefs&rsquo; children
and those of other people.</p>
<p>Body-staining is usual with both men and women, who do it for
themselves, or get others to help them. There is no ceremony in
connection with it. The colours generally adopted are red,
greyish-yellow and black. The red stain is procured from an earth,
which is obtained from the low countries; but they themselves also have
an earth which is used, and produces a more bronzy red. The yellow
stain is also got from an earth. All these coloured earths are worked
into a paste with water, or with animal fat, if they can get it. I
think they also get a red stain from the fruit of a species of
Pandanus; but I am not quite clear as to this. The black stain is
obtained from crushed vegetable ashes mixed with fat or water. The
staining of the face is usually of a simple character. It may cover the
whole face all in one colour or in different colours, and often one
side of the face is stained one colour, and the other side another
colour. They also make stripes and spots or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2444" href="#xd26e2444" name=
"xd26e2444">42</a>]</span>either of them of any colour or colours on
any part of the face. The red colour (I think especially that obtained
from the Pandanus fruit) is also often applied in staining the whole
body, this being especially done for dances and visiting; though a
young dandy will often do it at other times. The black is the symbol of
mourning, and will be referred to hereafter.</p>
<p>Hairdressing may be conveniently dealt with here. The Mafulu
hairdressing is quite simple and rough, very different from the big,
spreading, elaborately prepared and carefully combed mops of Mekeo.
This is a factor which a traveller in this part of New Guinea may well
bear in mind in connection with his impedimenta, as he has no
difficulty in getting the Kuni and Mafulu people to carry packages on
their heads, which the Mekeo folk are unwilling to do.</p>
<p>The modes in which the men dress their hair, so far as I was able to
notice, may be roughly divided into the following
categories:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) A simple crop of hair either cut quite
close or allowed to grow fairly long, or anything between these two,
but not dressed in any way, and probably uncombed, unkempt and untidy.
This is the commonest form. (<i>b</i>) The same as (<i>a</i>), but with
a band round the hair, separating the upper part of it from the lower,
and giving the former a somewhat chignon-like appearance, (<i>c</i>)
The hair done up all over the head in three-stranded plaits a few
inches long, and about an eighth of an inch thick, having the
appearance of short thick pieces of string, (<i>d</i>) The top of the
head undressed, but the sides, and sometimes the back, of the head done
up in plaits like (<i>c</i>). (<i>e</i>) A <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2473" href="#xd26e2473" name=
"xd26e2473">43</a>]</span>manufactured long shaped fringe of hair,
human, but not the hair of the wearer (Plate <a href="#p020">20</a>,
Fig. 3), is often worn over the forehead, just under the wearer&rsquo;s
own hair, so as to form, as it were, a part of it, pieces of string
being attached to the ends of the fringe and passed round the back of
the head, where they are tied. These fringes are made by tying a series
of little bunches of hair close to one another along the double string,
which forms the base of the fringe. Specimens examined by me were about
12 inches long and 1&frac14; inches wide (this width being the length
of the bunches of hair), and contained about twenty bunches. It is
usual to have two or three of these strings of bunches of hair tied
together at the ends, thus making one broad fringe. These fringes are
often worn in connection with styles (<i>c</i>) and (<i>d</i>) of
hairdressing; but I never noticed them in association with (<i>a</i>)
and (<i>b</i>).</p>
<p>I was told that men who have become bald sometimes wear complete
artificial wigs, though I never saw an example of this.</p>
<p>The hairdressing of the women seemed to be similar to that of the
men, except that I never saw the chignon-producing band, that they do
not wear fringes, and that the entire or partial plaiting of the hair
is more frequently adopted by them than it is by the men. I do not know
whether the women ever indulge in entire wigs.</p>
<p>Method (<i>a</i>) is seen in many of the plates. Method (<i>b</i>)
is illustrated, though not very well, in Plate <a href="#p009">9</a>
(the fourth and fifth man from the left) and in Plate <a href=
"#p021">21</a> (the young man to the left, behind). Method (<i>c</i>)
is adopted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2513" href="#xd26e2513"
name="xd26e2513">44</a>]</span>by four of the women in the
frontispiece, by some of the women in Plate <a href="#p016">16</a>, by
the woman in Plate <a href="#p017">17</a>, and by the little girl in
Plates <a href="#p022">22</a> and <a href="#p023">23</a>. Method
(<i>d</i>) is well illustrated by the second woman from the right in
the frontispiece.</p>
<p>The cutting of the hair of both men and women is effected with sharp
pieces of stone of the sort used for making adze blades, or with sharp
pieces of bamboo or shell.</p>
<p>Infant deformation is not practised in any form by the Mafulu
people; nor do they circumcise their children.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The string-like plaits in which men and women arrange
their hair, and especially those of the women, are often decorated with
ornaments. Small cowrie and other shells, or native or European beads,
or both, are strung by women on to these plaits, sometimes in a line
along all or the greater part of the length of the plait, sometimes as
a pendant at the end of it, and sometimes in both ways; and any other
small ornamental object may be added. Dogs&rsquo; teeth are also used
by both men and women in the same way; but these are, I think, more
commonly strung in line along the plaits, rather than suspended at the
ends of them. Both men and women wear suspended at the ends of these
plaits wild betel-nut fruit, looking like elongated acorns; and men,
but not women, wear in the same way small pieces of cane, an inch or
two long, into which the ends of the plaits are inserted. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2539" href="#xd26e2539" name=
"xd26e2539">45</a>]</span>All these forms of decoration may be found
associated together. They are in the case of men usually confined to
the plaits at the sides, being also often attached to the side ends of
the artificial fringes; but they are sometimes used for the back of the
head also. The women often wear them also at the top of the head, and
in wearing them at the sides sometimes have them hanging in long
strings reaching to the shoulders.</p>
<p>Plate <a href="#p024">24</a> (Figs. 1, 2, 5, and 6) and Plate
<a href="#p025">25</a> (Figs. 2 and 4) are ornamented plaits cut off
the heads of women. The ornaments shown include beads, shells, discs
made out of shells, dogs&rsquo; teeth and betel-nut fruit. Plate
<a href="#p024">24</a> (Figs. 3 and 4) are ornamented plaits cut off
the heads of men, one of them having a cane pendant, and the other a
pendant of betel-nut.</p>
<p>The appearance of these things, as worn, is seen in Plates <a href=
"#p016">16</a>, <a href="#p026">26</a>, <a href="#p027">27</a>,
<a href="#p028">28</a> and <a href="#p029">29</a> (the habit of wearing
a single dog-tooth at each side of the head, as shown by <a href=
"#p027">27</a>, being a common one, and <a href="#p028">28</a> showing
the equally common habit of wearing a couple of betel-nuts at each
side). Their appearance, when worn in abundance for a festal dance, is
excellently shown in the frontispiece and in Plate <a href=
"#p017">17</a>; and the little girl in Plates <a href="#p022">22</a>
and <a href="#p023">23</a>, though too young to be a dancer, is
decorated for an occasion.</p>
<p>Pigs&rsquo; tails are a common head decoration for women, and are
also worn, though not so frequently, by men. These tails are covered
with the natural hair of the tail, and are brown-coloured. They are
suspended by strings passing round the crown of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2587" href="#xd26e2587" name=
"xd26e2587">46</a>]</span>the head or from the plaits at the sides of
the head. They are generally only about 6 inches long; but sometimes
the ornaments into which they are made are much longer, and I have seen
them worn by women hanging down as far as the level of the breast.
These pigtails are sometimes worn hanging in clusters of several tails.
They are also often, in the case of women, decorated with shells,
beads, dogs&rsquo; teeth, etc., which are attached like tassels to
their upper ends.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2589src" href="#xd26e2589"
name="xd26e2589src">12</a></p>
<p>Plate <a href="#p030">30</a>, Fig. 3 shows a pigtail ornament for
hanging over the head, with the tails suspended on both sides and
strings of beads and dogs&rsquo; teeth hanging from the upper ends of
the tails. The ornament is worn by the middle man in Plate <a href=
"#p009">9</a> and by the little girl figured in Plates <a href=
"#p022">22</a> and <a href="#p023">23</a>, and it is seen more
extensively worn by women decorated for dancing in the frontispiece and
in Plate <a href="#p017">17</a>, and by the girl in Plate <a href=
"#p071">71</a>.</p>
<p>A peculiar and less usual sort of head ornament (Plate <a href=
"#p030">30</a>, Fig. 4), worn by both men and women, is a cluster of
about a dozen or less of bark cloth strings, about 1&frac12; feet long,
fastened together at the top, and there suspended by a string tied
round the top of the head, so as to hang down like the lashes of a
several-thonged whip over the back. The individual strings of the
cluster are quite thin, but they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2621" href="#xd26e2621" name="xd26e2621">47</a>]</span>are
decorated with the yellow and brown straw-like material above referred
to in connection with abdominal belt No. 6 (being prepared from the
same plant, apparently Dendrobium, and in the same way), the material
being twisted in a close spiral round the strings, and making them
look, when seen from a short distance off, like strings of very small
yellow and brown beads, irregularly arranged in varying lengths of the
two colours, shading off gradually from one to the other. Even when so
bound round, these strings are only about 1&frasl;16&#8203; to &#8539;
of an inch thick.</p>
<p>The Mafulu comb (Plate <a href="#p030">30</a>, Fig. 2) differs in
construction from the wooden combs, all made in one piece, which are
commonly used in Mekeo. It is made of four, five, or six thin pieces of
wood, which are left blunt at one end, but are sharpened to points at
the other. These are bound together with straw-like work, sometimes
beautifully done, the binding being nearly always near to the blunt
ends, though it is sometimes almost in the middle.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2628src" href="#xd26e2628" name="xd26e2628src">13</a> The
combs so made are flat, with the blunt ends converging and generally
fastened together, and the long sharp ends, which are the ends to be
inserted into the hair, spreading outwards. The bound-up blunt ends are
in fact a point, or, say, half an inch or less (occasionally more)
across. The spread of the sharp ends varies from 1 to 2 inches or more.
The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2631" href="#xd26e2631" name=
"xd26e2631">48</a>]</span>straw-like binding may be light or dark
brown, or partly one and partly the other. Sometimes only the two
outside prongs meet together at the blunt end, and the inner prongs do
not extend much, or at all, beyond the upper edge of the straw-like
work binding. The fastening together of the blunt converging tips is
done sometimes with native thread just at the tips, and sometimes with
a little straw work rather further down; occasionally it is missing
altogether. The comb figured is not so converging at the blunt ends or
so spreading at the sharp ends as is usual, and its blunt ends are not
bound together. These combs are only worn by men; they are commonly
worn in front, projecting forwards over the forehead, as is done in
Mekeo; but they are also worn at the back of the head, projecting
sideways to either right or left. A feather (generally a white cockatoo
feather), or sometimes two feathers, are often inserted into the
straw-like work of the comb, so as to stand up vertically when the comb
is worn, and there wave, or rather wag, backwards and forwards in the
wind. I could not learn any significance in these feathers, such as
applies to many of the upright head feathers worn by the young men of
Mekeo. The comb is worn by several of the men figured in Plate <a href=
"#p009">9</a>, one of them wearing it in front and the others having it
standing out sideways at the back.</p>
<p>The almost universal type of earring (Plate <a href="#p020">20</a>,
Fig. 1), varying from 2 to 3 inches in circumference, is made out of
the tail of the cuscus. The ring is made by removing the hair from the
animal&rsquo;s tail, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2641" href=
"#xd26e2641" name="xd26e2641">49</a>]</span>drying the tail, and
fastening the pointed end into or on to the blunt cut-off stump end,
tying them firmly together. The ring is then bound closely round with
the yellow and brown material (Dendrobium) of belt No. 6; but a space
of 1 or 2 inches is generally left uncovered at the part where the two
ends of the tail are fastened together. The simplest form is a single
earring, which passes through the hole in the ear; but I have seen two
rings hanging to the ear; and frequently a second ring is hung on to
the first, and often a third to the second, and sometimes a fourth to
the third; or perhaps, instead of the fourth ring, there may be two
rings hanging to the second one. In fact, there are varieties of ways
in which the fancy of the wearer and the number of rings he possesses
will cause him to wear them. They are worn by both men and
women.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2643src" href="#xd26e2643" name=
"xd26e2643src">14</a> They may be seen in several plates, but
unfortunately are not very clear. The most distinct are, I think, those
worn by the second woman from the left in Plate <a href="#p026">26</a>
and the woman on the left in Plate <a href="#p028">28</a>. The second
woman from the left in the frontispiece has two of them hanging from
her right ear.</p>
<p>Pigs&rsquo; tails, similar to those worn from the hair, are also
worn by both men and women, especially the latter, suspended from the
ears; and here again they vary much in length, and are often decorated
with tassel-like hanging ornaments of shells, beads, etc.</p>
<p>Forehead ornaments (Plate <a href="#p030">30</a>, Fig 5) are made by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2659" href="#xd26e2659" name=
"xd26e2659">50</a>]</span>men and worn by them at dances. This ornament
is a band, very slightly curved, which is worn across the forehead,
just under and surrounding the basis of the dancing feathers. It is
generally about 16 inches long and between 4 and 5 inches broad in the
middle, from which it narrows somewhat towards the ends. Its
manufacture consists of a ground basis of the material of belt No. 5,
into which are interplaited in geometric patterns the two black and
yellow and brown materials which are used for belt No. 6. It is fixed
on to the forehead by means of strings attached to its two ends, and
passing round, and tied at the back of, the head.</p>
<p>Nose ornaments. These are straight pencil-shaped pieces of shell,
generally about 6 inches long, which are passed through the hole in the
septum of the nose. They are only worn at dances and on special
occasions; but the people from time to time insert bits of wood or cane
or bone or some other thing into the hole for the purpose of keeping it
open. There are temporary pegs in the noses of the fifth man to the
left in Plate <a href="#p009">9</a> and the man in Plate <a href=
"#p010">10</a>. The nose ornament is worn by the woman to the extreme
right in the frontispiece.</p>
<p>Necklaces and straight pendants, suspended from the neck and hanging
over the chest, are common, though they are not usually worn in
anything approaching the profusion seen in Mekeo and on the coast.
These are made chiefly of shells of various sorts (cut or whole),
dogs&rsquo; teeth and beads, as in Mekeo. The shells include the
cowries and the small closely packed overlapping cut shells so
generally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2672" href="#xd26e2672"
name="xd26e2672">51</a>]</span>used in Mekeo for necklaces, and the
flat disc-like shell sections, which are here, as in Mekeo, specially
used for straight hanging pendants; also those lovely large
crescent-shaped discs of pearl shell, which are well known to New
Guinea travellers. The shells are, of course, all obtained directly or
indirectly from the coast; in fact, these are some of the chief
articles for which the mountain people exchange their stone implements
and special mountain feathers, so the similarity in the ornaments is to
be expected; but it is only within a quite recent time that the pearl
crescents have found their way to Mafulu. I do not propose to describe
at length the various forms of shell ornament, as they are very similar
to, and indeed I think practically the same as, those of Mekeo. Some of
the necklaces are figured in Plates <a href="#p031">31</a>, <a href=
"#p032">32</a> and <a href="#p033">33</a>, and they are worn by many of
the people figured in other plates, especially the frontispiece and
Plate <a href="#p017">17</a>. Straight pendant ornaments are seen in
the frontispiece and in Plates <a href="#p006">6</a>, <a href=
"#p017">17</a>, <a href="#p026">26</a> and others. The crescent-shaped
pearl ornaments are seen in the frontispiece and in Plates <a href=
"#p006">6</a>, <a href="#p007">7</a>, <a href="#p016">16</a>, <a href=
"#p028">28</a> and others, a very large one being worn by the little
girl in Plate <a href="#p071">71</a>.</p>
<p>There is, however, one shell necklace which is peculiar to the
mountains, and, I think, to Mafulu (I do not know whether the Kuni
people also wear it), where it is worn as an emblem of mourning by
persons who are relatives of the deceased, but who are not sufficiently
closely related to him to stain themselves with black during the period
of mourning. This necklace is made of white cowrie shells varying in
size <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2714" href="#xd26e2714" name=
"xd26e2714">52</a>]</span>from half an inch to an inch long, each of
which has its convex side ground away, so as to show on one side the
untouched mouth of the shell and on the other an open cavity. The
shells are strung, sometimes closely and sometimes loosely, on to a
double band of thin cord. Specimens of this type of necklace measured
by me varied in length from 36 inches (with 97 shells) to 20 inches
(with 38 shells). It is worn until the period of mourning is formally
terminated. The middle necklace in Plate <a href="#p033">33</a> is a
mourning shell necklace, and it is seen on the neck of the woman to the
right in Plate <a href="#p029">29</a>.</p>
<p>Pigs&rsquo; tail ornaments similar to those already described are
also worn suspended by neck-bands over the chest.</p>
<p>Armlets and wrist-bands are worn by both men and women, and more or
less by children, including quite young ones, at the higher end of the
upper arm and just above the wrist. They are made by men only, and vary
in width from half an inch to 5 or 6 inches, the wider ones being
generally worn on the upper arm. There are several common forms of
these: (1) The more usual form (Plate <a href="#p034">34</a>, Fig. 4)
is made of the thin and finely plaited stone-grey material described in
abdominal belt No. 5, and is made in the same way, subject to the
difference that the plaiting is more closely done. Measured specimens
of this armlet varied in width from 1 to 2&frac14; inches, and
displayed different varieties of diagonal twill stitch. (2) Another
common form (Plate <a href="#p034">34</a>, Fig. 3) is made of the
coarser-plaited black and yellow and brown <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2732" href="#xd26e2732" name=
"xd26e2732">53</a>]</span>materials described concerning No. 6 belt,
and is made in the same way. Specimens of this armlet varied in width
from 1 to 5 inches. (3) There is another form which in fineness of
material and plait is between Nos. 1 and 2. I was told that this is
made out of another creeping plant, and is left in its own natural
unstained colour, which, however, in this case is a dull brown red. (4)
Another form (Plate <a href="#p034">34</a>, Fig. 2) is made of the
coarse dull red-brown and stone-yellow materials described with
reference to belt No. 2, and is made in the same way. A specimen of
this armlet was 2&frac14; inches wide. (5) Another form (Plate <a href=
"#p034">34</a>, Fig. 1) is in make something like No. 4, but the two
materials used are the stone-yellow material of belt No. 2 and the
black material of belt No. 6, and the plaiting materials are much finer
in thickness than are those of armlet No. 4. Specimens of this armlet
varied in width from &frac34; to 1&frac14; inches. (6) The beautiful
large cut single-shell wrist ornament, commonly worn on the coast and
plains, whence the Mafulu people procure it. Armlets will be seen worn
by many of the people figured in the plates.</p>
<p>There is no practice of putting armlets on young folk, and retaining
them in after life, so as to tighten round and contract the arm.</p>
<p>Leg-bands (Plate <a href="#p025">25</a>, Fig. 1) and anklets are
worn by both men and women, and also by children, just below the knee
and above the ankle.</p>
<p>There is a form of plaited leg-band somewhat similar in make to
armlet No. 5, and between half-an-inch and an inch in width, though the
colour of this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2749" href=
"#xd26e2749" name="xd26e2749">54</a>]</span>leg-band is a dull brown.
But the usual form of leg-band and anklet is made by women only out of
thread fibre by a process of manufacture quite distinct from the stiff
plait work adopted for some of the belts and for the armlets. They make
their thread out of fine vegetable fibre as they proceed with the
manufacture of the band, rolling the individual fibres with their hands
upon their thighs, and then rolling these fibres into two-strand
threads, and from time to time in this way making more thread, which is
worked into the open ends of the then working thread as it is
required&mdash;all this being done in the usual native method.</p>
<p>I had an opportunity of watching a woman making a leg-band, and I
think the process is worth describing. She first made a thread 5 or 6
feet long by the method above referred to, the thread being a
two-strand one, made out of small lengths about 5 or 6 inches long of
the original fibre, rolled together and added to from time to time
until the full length of 5 or 6 feet of thread had been made. The
thread was of the thickness of very coarse European thread or
exceedingly fine string. She next wound the thread into a triple loop
of the size of the proposed leg-band. This triple loop was to be the
base upon which she was to make the leg-band, of which it would form
the first line and upper edge. It was only about 11 inches in
circumference, and thus left two ends, one of which (I will call it
&ldquo;the working thread&rdquo;) was a long one, and the other of
which (I will call it &ldquo;the inside thread&rdquo;) was a short one.
Both these threads <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2753" href=
"#xd26e2753" name="xd26e2753">55</a>]</span>hung down together from the
same point (which I will call &ldquo;the starting point&rdquo;). She
then, commencing at the starting point, worked the working thread round
the triple base by a series of interlacing loops in the form shown
(very greatly magnified) in Fig. 1; but the loops were drawn quite
tight, and not left loose, as, for the purpose of illustration, I have
had to make them in the figure. This process was carried round the base
until she had again reached the starting point, at which stage the
base, with its tightly drawn loop work all around it, was firm and
strong, and there were still the two ends of thread hanging from the
starting point. Here and at subsequent stages of the work she added to
the lengths of these two ends from time to time in the way above
described when they needed it, and the two ends of thread were
therefore always present. Then began the making of the second line.
This was commenced at the starting point, from which the two ends of
thread hung, and was effected by a series of loops made with the
working thread in the way already described, except that these loops,
instead of passing round the whole of the base line, passed through
holes which she bored with a thorn, as she went on, in the extreme
bottom edge of that line, and also that, in making this second line,
she passed the inside thread through each loop before she drew the
latter tight; so that the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2755"
href="#xd26e2755" name="xd26e2755">56</a>]</span>second line was itself
composed of a single internal thread, around which the loops were
drawn. The second line was continued in this way until she again
reached the starting point (but, of course, one line lower down), from
which the two ends of thread hung down as before. The third and
following lines were made by a process identical with that of the
second one, the holes for each line being pricked through the bottom of
that above it. I did not see the completion of the band, but I may say
that the final line is similar to the second and subsequent ones, and
is not a triple-threaded line like the first one. It was amazing to see
this woman doing her work. She was an old woman, but she did the whole
of the work with her fingers, and she must have had wonderful eyesight
and steadiness of hand, as she made the minute scarcely visible prick
holes, and passed the end of her working thread through them, with the
utmost apparent ease and quickness.</p>

<p>The band thus produced is of very small, close, fine work, and is
quite soft, flexible and elastic, like European canvas, instead of
being stiff and hard, like the plaited belts and armlets. The band is
generally about an inch (more or less) in width. It is not dyed or
coloured in any way, but is often decorated with beads, which are
worked into the fabric in one or more horizontal lines, but as a rule,
I think, only at irregular intervals, and not in continuous lines.
These bands and anklets are seen in many of the plates. In Plates
<a href="#p010">10</a>, <a href="#p011">11</a> and <a href=
"#p012">12</a> the bead decorations are seen. <span class=

<p>Dancing aprons are made out of bark cloth by both men and women, but
coloured by men only. The apron, which is worn at dances by women only,
is about 6 to 12 inches wide. It is worn, as shown in Plate <a href=
"#p035">35</a>, in front of the body, being passed over the abdominal
belt or a cord so as to hang over it in two folds, one behind the
other; and the front fold, which is the part which shows (the back fold
being more or less concealed), and is generally 18 inches to 2 feet in
length, has at its base a fringe made by cutting the end of the cloth
up into strips, equal or unequal in width, the number of which may be
only six or less, or may be fifteen or twenty. The front fold is often
wholly or partly stained, the colour of the stain being usually yellow,
and is always more or less covered with a decorative design, the
colours of which are usually black and red. The back fold is generally
stained yellow, but never has any design upon it. The fringe is also
usually stained yellow, and is without design, except occasionally
perhaps a few horizontal lines of colour.</p>
<p>I may say here, as regards these colours, that, so far as my
observation went, the colours of the decorative patterns were always
black and red, and the general staining was always yellow; and indeed
the last-mentioned colour does not show up against the natural colour
of the cloth sufficiently clearly to adapt it for actual design work. I
am not, however, prepared to say that this allocation of the colours is
in fact an invariable one; and, as I know that red is used for general
staining of perineal bands and dancing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e2782" href="#xd26e2782" name="xd26e2782">58</a>]</span>ribbons,
it is possible that it, as well as yellow, is used for aprons.</p>
<p>Numerous variations of design are to be found in these garments; and
indeed I may say that it is in these and in the feather head
decorations that the Mafulu people mainly indulge such artistic powers
as they possess.</p>
<p>Plates <a href="#p036">36</a> to <a href="#p043">43</a> are examples
of decoration of the front folds of these dancing aprons<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2794src" href="#xd26e2794" name=
"xd26e2794src">15</a>; and I give the following particulars concerning
them, first stating that, subject to what may appear in my particulars,
the darker lines and spots represent black ones in the apron, and the
lighter ones represent red ones.</p>

<p>Dancing ribbons are made out of bark cloth by both men and women,
but are coloured by men only. These are worn by both men and women at
dances, the ribbons hanging round the body from the abdominal belt or a
cord, three or four or five of them being worn by one person, and one
of these commonly hanging in front. They are generally 2 or 3 inches
wide and about 4 feet long, but a portion of this length is required
for hitching the ribbon round the belt. I think their ornamentation is
confined to staining in transverse bands of alternating colour or of
one colour and unstained cloth. <a href="#p013">Plate 13, Fig. 4</a>,
illustrates the colouring of two ribbons (each 2 inches wide), the
alternation in one case being red and yellow, and in the other red and
unstained cloth; and the men figured in <a href="#p070">Plate 70</a>
are wearing ribbons, though they are not very clearly shown in the
plate.</p>
<p>The feather ornaments for the head, and especially those worn at
dances, and the feather ornaments worn on the back at dances present
such an enormous variety of colours and designs that it would be
impossible to describe them here without very greatly increasing the
length of the book. The ornaments are often very large, sometimes
containing eight or ten or even twelve rows of feathers, one behind
another. They can usually be distinguished from those made by the Mekeo
people by a general inferiority in design and make of the ornament as a
whole, the Mafulu people having less artistic skill in this respect
than the people of the lowlands. The ornaments include feathers of
parrots, cockatoos, hornbills, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2894"
href="#xd26e2894" name="xd26e2894">60</a>]</span>cassowaries, birds of
paradise, bower birds and some others. One never or rarely sees
feathers of sea-birds, or waterfowl, or Goura pigeons (which, I was
told, are not found among the mountains), as the Mafulu people in their
trading with the people of the plains take in exchange things which
they cannot themselves procure, rather than feathers, which are so
plentiful with them.</p>
<p>The black cassowary feather is important in Mafulu as being the
special feather distinction of chiefs; but, though chiefs are as a rule
possessed of more and better ornaments than are the poorer and
unimportant people, they have no other special and distinctive
ornament.</p>
<p>Plates <a href="#p044">44</a> and <a href="#p045">45</a> illustrate
some of these head feather ornaments. Plate <a href="#p044">44</a>,
Fig. 1, shows an ornament made out of the brown fibrous exterior of the
wild betel-nut, black pigeon feathers and white cockatoo feathers, the
betel fibre and black pigeon feathers being, I was told, only used in
the mountains. Plate <a href="#p044">44</a>, Fig. 2, shows one made out
of brown feathers of young cassowary, white cockatoo feathers and
red-black parrot feathers. Plate <a href="#p044">44</a>, Fig. 3, shows
one made out of bright red and green parrot feathers. Plate <a href=
"#p045">45</a>, Fig. 1, shows one made out of black cassowary feathers,
white cockatoo feathers, red parrot feathers and long red feathers of
the bird of paradise. Plate <a href="#p045">45</a>, Fig. 2, is made of
cassowary feathers only. This ornament is worn in front of the head,
over the forehead, and is specially worn by chiefs.</p>
<p>Plate <a href="#p046">46</a>, Fig. 1, shows a head feather ornament
which is peculiar to the mountains. The crescent-shaped <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2927" href="#xd26e2927" name=
"xd26e2927">61</a>]</span>body of the ornament, which is made of short
feathers taken from the neck of the cassowary, is worn in front over
the forehead, and the cockade of hawk feathers stands up over the
head.</p>
<p>Plate <a href="#p046">46</a>, Fig. 2, shows a back ornament of
cassowary feathers which is specially intended to be worn by chiefs at
dances. The custom is to have from five to twelve of these ornaments
hanging vertically side by side, suspended to a horizontal stick, which
is fastened on the chief&rsquo;s back at the height of the shoulders,
so that the feathers hang like a mantle over his back. The mode in
which feather ornaments for the back are hung on sticks is seen in
Plate <a href="#p070">70</a>, where a stick with pendant ornaments is
being held by two boys in front.</p>
<p>Plaited frames (Plate <a href="#p047">47</a>) are worn by men in
connection with these head feather ornaments. These frames are flat
curved bands, rigid or nearly so, generally forming half or nearly half
a circle of an external diameter of about 9 inches, and being about 1
inch in width. They are worn at dances and on solemn occasions. They
are placed round the top of the forehead, not vertically, but with
their upper edges sloping obliquely forward, and have at their ends
strings, which pass over the ears and are tied at the back of the head.
These frames help to support the feather ornaments, and prevent them
from falling down over the face. They are made by men only. A
groundwork of small split cane or other material runs in parallel
curved lines from end to end, single pieces of the material being
generally doubled back at the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2942"
href="#xd26e2942" name="xd26e2942">62</a>]</span>ends so as to form
several lines; and this is strengthened and ornamented by interplaiting
into it either split cane or some other material obtained from the
splitting of the inside fibre of a plant in the way previously referred
to. There are varieties of material and of pattern worked up in
different designs of interplaiting. Some of the materials are
uncoloured or merely the natural colour of the material, and others are
in two colours, generally brown or reddish-brown and yellow. These
frames display a considerable amount of variety of artistic design.</p>
<p>The feather erections used at special and important dances, and
especially those worn by chiefs, are enormous things, towering 6 or 12
feet above the wearer&rsquo;s head, and are generally larger than those
of Mekeo. They are held in a framework, which has an inverted
basket-shaped part to rest on the head, and downward pointing rods,
which are tied to the shoulders. The frames are to a great extent
similar to those of Mekeo, but, having a larger burden to bear, they
are more strongly made. These feather erections and their frames are
seen in Plate <a href="#p070">70</a>.</p>
<p>Here, as in other parts of New Guinea, both men and women, but
especially men, love to decorate themselves with bright flowers and
leaves and grasses, these being worn in the hair and in bunches stuck
into their belts, armlets and leg-bands, and indeed in any places where
they can be conveniently fastened.</p>
<p>It is not the practice with the Mafulu for mothers to wear the
umbilical cords of any of their children, though apparently the Kuni
people do so. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2954" href=

photographing the drawings. It would have been more satisfactory if I

remarkably similar to that of my Mafulu belt No. 7, though in other
respects it differs from the latter, and it is much smaller. The only
other thing of similar hank-like form which I have been able to find at
the Museum is a small belt or head ornament (it is said to be the
latter) made by Sakai people of the Malay Peninsula.&nbsp;<a class=

through the hole in his nose; and that the Pokau people sometimes pass

hole open. In neither of these cases is the practice a part of an

<h3 class="main">Daily Life.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The early morning finds the wife and young children
and unmarried daughters in the house. The husband has been sleeping
either there or in the <i lang="xx">emone</i> (clubhouse), but most
probably the latter. The unmarried sons are in the <i lang=
"xx">emone</i>, except any very young ones, who have not been formally
admitted to it in a way which will be hereafter described. The women
cook the breakfast for the whole family inside the house at about six
or seven o&rsquo;clock, and then take the food of the men to the
<i lang="xx">emone</i>. After breakfast most of the men and women go
off to the gardens and the bush. The women&rsquo;s work there is
chiefly the planting of sweet potatoes, taro and other things, and
cleaning the gardens; and in the afternoon they get food from the
gardens and firewood from the bush, all of which they bring home to the
village; also they have to clear off the undergrowth from newly cleared
bush. The men&rsquo;s work is mainly the yam and banana and sugar-cane
planting, each in its season, and the cutting down of big trees and
making fences, if they happen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2972"
href="#xd26e2972" name="xd26e2972">64</a>]</span>to be opening out new
garden land. They also sometimes help the women with their work. Or
they may have hunting expeditions in the bush, or go off in fishing
parties to the river. In all matters the men of Mafulu, though lazy,
are not so lazy as those of Mekeo and the coast. In the middle of the
day the women cook the meal for everyone in the gardens, this being
done on the spot, and there they all eat it. At three, four, or five
o&rsquo;clock all the people of the village have returned to it, except
perhaps when they are very busy taking advantage of good weather for
making new clearings or other special work. In the evening they have
another meal cooked in the village. At every meal in the village the
pigs have to be fed also, these sharing the food of the people
themselves, or feeding on raw potatoes. Unless there is dancing going
on, or they are tempted by a fine moonlight night to sit out talking,
the people all terminate their routine day by going to bed early.</p>
<p>As regards the daily social conduct of the people among themselves,
I was told that the members of a family generally live harmoniously
together (subject as regards husbands and wives to the matters which
will be mentioned later), that children are usually treated kindly and
affectionately by their parents, and that there is very little
quarrelling within a village; and what I saw when I was among the
Mafulu people certainly seemed to confirm all this.</p>
<p>There are various detailed matters of daily life which will appear
under their appropriate headings; but I will here deal with a few of
them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e2978" href="#xd26e2978" name=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Food.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The vegetable foods of the Mafulu people are sweet
potato and other plants of the same type, yam and other foods of the
same type, taro and other foods of that type, banana of different
sorts, sugar-cane, a kind of wild native bean, a cultivated reed-like
plant with an asparagus flavour (what it is I do not know), several
plants of the pumpkin and cucumber type, one of them being very small,
like a gherkin, fruit from two different species of Pandanus, almonds,
the fruit of the <i lang="xx">malage</i> (described later on), and
others, both cultivated and wild. The sugar-cane is specially eaten by
them when working in the gardens.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2987src"
href="#xd26e2987" name="xd26e2987src">1</a></p>
<p>Their animal food consists of wild pig and, on occasions, village
pig, a small form of cassowary, kangaroo, a small kind of wallaby,
kangaroo rat, &ldquo;iguana,&rdquo; an animal called <i lang=
"xx">gaivale</i> (I could not find out what this is), various wild
birds, fish, eels, mice, a large species of snake and other things.</p>
<p>Their staple drink is water, but when travelling they cut down a
species of bamboo, and drink the watery fluid which it contains. After
boiling any food in bamboo stems they drink the water which has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3016" href="#xd26e3016" name=
"xd26e3016">66</a>]</span>been used for the purpose, and which has
become a sort of thin flavoured soup.</p>
<p>Betel-chewing is apparently not indulged in by these people as
extensively as it is done in Mekeo and on the coast; but they like it
well enough, and for a month or so before a big feast, during which
period they are under a strict taboo restriction as to food, they
indulge in it largely. The betel used by them is not the cultivated
form used in Mekeo and on the coast, but a wild species, only about
half the size of the other; and the lime used is not, as in Mekeo and
on the coast, made by grinding down sea-shells, but is obtained from
the mountain stone, which is ground down to a powder. The gourds (Plate
<a href="#p051">51</a>, Figs. 6 and 7) in which the lime is carried are
similar to those used in Mekeo, except that usually they are not
ornamented, or, if they are so, the ornamentation is only done in
simple straight-lined geometric patterns. The spatulae are sometimes
very simply and rudely decorated. The people spit out the betel after
chewing, instead of swallowing it, as is the custom in Mekeo.</p>

<h3 class="main">Cooking and Eating and Their Utensils.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">They have no cooking utensils, other than the simple
pieces of bamboo stem, which they use for boiling.</p>
<p>Their usual methods of cooking are roasting and boiling.</p>
<p>Roasting is usually effected by making a fire, letting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3032" href="#xd26e3032" name=
"xd26e3032">67</a>]</span>it die down into red-hot ashes, and then
putting the food without wrap or covering into the ashes, turning it
from time to time. They also roast by holding the food on sticks in the
flame of the burning fire, turning it occasionally. Stone cooking is
adopted for pig and other meats. They make a big fire, on the top of
which they spread the stones; when the stones are hot enough, they
remove some of them, place the meat without wrap or covering on the
others, then place the removed stones on the meat, and finally pile on
these stones a big covering of leaves to keep in the heat. Stone
cooking in the gardens is done in a slightly different way; there they
dig in the ground a round hole about 1 foot deep and from 1&frac12; to
2 feet in diameter, and in this hole they make their fire, on which
they pile their stones; and the rest of the process is the same as
before. This hole-making process is never adopted in the village. The
only reason for it which was suggested was that the method was quicker,
and that in the gardens they are in a hurry. Of course, holes of this
sort dug in the open village enclosure would be a source of danger,
especially at night.</p>
<p>Boiling is done in pieces of bamboo about 4 inches in diameter and
about 15 or 18 inches long. They fill these with water, put the food
into them, and then place or hold the bamboo stems in a slanting
position in the flames. This method is specially used for cooking sweet
potatoes, but it is their only method of boiling anything. Water, which
they keep stored and carry in bamboo receptacles and hollow pumpkins,
is boiled in bamboo stems in the same way. The bamboo <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3036" href="#xd26e3036" name=
"xd26e3036">68</a>]</span>storage vessels are generally from 2 to 5
feet long, the intersecting nodes, other than that at one end, having
been removed. The pumpkins (Plate <a href="#p052">52</a>, Figs. 2 and
3) are similar to those used by the Roro coast people and in Mekeo,
except that the usual form, instead of being rather short and broad
with a narrow opening, is longer and narrower, some of them being, say,
3 feet long, and often very curved and crooked in shape.</p>
<p>Their only eating utensils are wooden dishes and small pieces of
wood, or sometimes of cassowary or kangaroo bone, which are used as
forks, and pieces of split bamboo, which are used for cutting meat; but
these latter are used for other purposes, and rather come within the
list of ordinary implements, and will be there described. They also use
prepared pig-bones as forks; but these again are largely used for other
purposes, and will be described under the same heading.</p>
<p>The dishes (Plate <a href="#p052">52</a>, Fig. 1) are made out of
the trunk of a tree called <i>ongome</i>. The usual length of a dish,
without its handles, is between 1 and 2 feet; its width varies from 9
inches to 1 foot, and its depth from 3 to 6 inches. It is rudely carved
out of the tree-trunk,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3051src" href=
"#xd26e3051" name="xd26e3051src">2</a> the work being done with stone
adzes&mdash;unless they happen to possess European axes&mdash;and it
generally has a handle at one or both ends. It is not decorated with
carving in any way. The common form of handle is merely a simple knob
about 3 inches long and 1&frac12; inches wide. But it is sometimes less
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3054" href="#xd26e3054" name=
"xd26e3054">69</a>]</span>simple, and I have a dish one of the handles
of which is divided into two projecting pieces about 7&frac12; inches
long and joined to each other at the end. The handle is always carved
out of the same piece of wood as is the dish; never made separately and
afterwards attached. The wooden forks are simply bits cut from trees
and sharpened at one end, and they are without prongs. Their use is
only temporary, and they are not permanently stored as household
utensils. The cassowary and kangaroo bone implements (Plate <a href=
"#p025">25</a>, Fig. 3) are also merely roughly pointed unpronged
pieces of bone, and otherwise without special form. When eating
<i lang="fr">en famille</i> they do not always use these pointed wooden
and bone sticks, but very commonly take the food out of the dish with
their hands only; but if the family had guests with them they would
probably use the sticks more, and their hands less. The men and women
often eat together, sitting round the dish and helping themselves out
of it, though, if there are too many to do this conveniently, pieces
will be handed out to some of them.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Various Implements.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Besides the cooking and eating implements above
described and other things, such as weapons of war and of hunting and
fishing, and implements for manufacture, agriculture and music, which
will be dealt with under their own headings, there are a few
miscellaneous things which may be conveniently described here.</p>
<p>Bamboo knives (Plate <a href="#p051">51</a>, Fig. 5). These are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3073" href="#xd26e3073" name=
"xd26e3073">70</a>]</span>simple strips made out of a special mountain
form of bamboo, and are generally 8 to 10 inches long and about 1 inch
wide. One edge is left straight for its whole length, and the other is
cut away near the end, very much as we cut away one side of a quill
pen, so as to produce a sharp point. The side edge which is used for
cutting is the one which is not cut away at the end; and when it gets
blunt it is renewed by simply peeling off a length of fibre, thus
producing a new edge, bevelled inwards towards the concave side of the
implement, and making a hard and very sharp fresh cutting edge. The
point can of course be sharpened at any time in the obvious way.</p>
<p>Pig-bone implements (Plate <a href="#p051">51</a>, Fig. 2). These
are the implements which are often used as forks, but they have
straight edges also with which they are used as scraping knives, and
they are utilised for many other purposes. The implement, which is, I
think, similar to what is commonly found in Mekeo and on the coast, is
made out of the leg-bone of a pig, and is generally from 5 to 8 inches
long. One side of the bone is ground away, so as to make the implement
flattish in section, one side (the outside unground part of the bone)
being somewhat convex, and the other (where the bone has been ground
away) being rather concave. Some of the joint end of the bone is left
to serve as a handle; and from this the bone is made to narrow down to
a blunt, rather flattish and rounded point, somewhat like that of a
pointed paper-cutter. The side edge is used for scraping, and the point
for sticking into things. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3080"
href="#xd26e3080" name="xd26e3080">71</a>]</span></p>
<p>Smoking pipes are in the ordinary well-known form of Mekeo and the
coast, being made of sections of bamboo stem in which the natural
intersecting node near the mouthpiece end is bored and the node at the
other end is left closed, and between these two nodes, near to the
closed one, is a flute-like hole, in which is placed the cigarette of
tobacco wrapped up in a leaf. They are, however, generally not
ornamented; or, if they are so, it is merely in a simple geometric
pattern of straight lines. I obtained one pipe (Plate <a href=
"#p051">51</a>, Fig. 1) of an unusual type, being much smaller than is
usual. A special feature of this pipe is its decoration, which includes
groups of concentric circles. This is the only example of a curved line
which I ever met with among the Mafulu villages, and it is probable
that it had not been made there.</p>
<p>Boring drills (Plate <a href="#p051">51</a>, Fig. 4) are also
similar to those of Mekeo and the coast, except that there the
fly-wheel is, I think, usually a horizontal circular disc, through the
centre of which the upright shaft of the implement passes, whereas in
the Mafulu boring instrument the fly-wheel, through which the shaft
passes, is a rudely cut flat horizontal piece of wood about 9 or 10
inches long, 2 inches broad, and half an inch or less thick, and also
that in Mafulu the native point, made out of a pointed fragment of the
stone used for making club-heads, adze blades and cloth-beaters, is not
generally replaced by a European iron point, as is so commonly the case
in Mekeo and near the coast. These drills are used for boring
dogs&rsquo; teeth and shells and other similar hard-substanced
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3091" href="#xd26e3091" name=
"xd26e3091">72</a>]</span>things, but are useless for boring articles
of wood or other soft substances, in which the roughly formed point
would stick.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3093src" href="#xd26e3093"
name="xd26e3093src">3</a></p>
<p>Fire-making. This is a question of process, rather than of
implement, but may be dealt with here. To produce fire, the Mafulu
native takes two pieces of very dry and inflammable wood, one larger
than the other, and some dry bark cloth fluff. He then holds the
smaller piece of wood and the fluff together, and rubs them on the
larger piece of wood. After four or five minutes the fluff catches
fire, without bursting into actual flame, upon which the native
continues the rubbing process, blowing gently upon the fluff, until the
two pieces of wood begin to smoulder, and can then be blown into a
sufficient flame for lighting a fire.</p>
<p>Carrying bags. These are all made of network. I shall say something
about the mode of netting and colouring them hereafter, and will here
only deal with the bags and their use. They are of various sizes,</p>
<p>(1) There are the large bags used by women for carrying heavy
objects, such as firewood, vegetables and fruit, which they bring back
to the village on their return in the afternoon from the gardens and
bush. These bags are carried in the usual way, the band over the
opening of the bag being passed across the front of the head above the
forehead, and the bag hanging over the back behind. They are curved in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3105" href="#xd26e3105" name=
"xd26e3105">73</a>]</span>shape, the ends of the bag being at both its
top and bottom edges higher than are the centres of those edges, so
that, when a bag is laid out flat, its top line is a concave one and
its bottom line is a convex one. The network at the two ends of the top
line is continued into the loop band by means of which the bag is
carried. The usual dimensions of one of these bags, as it lies flat and
unstretched on a table (the measurements being made along the curved
lines) are as follows&mdash;top line about 2 feet, bottom line about 3
feet, and side lines about 18 inches. But when filled with vegetables,
firewood, etc., they expand considerably, especially those made of
&ldquo;Mafulu network,&rdquo; of which I shall speak hereafter. These
bags are uncoloured. (2) There are similar, but somewhat smaller, bags,
in which the women carry lighter things, and which in particular they
use for carrying their babies. They frequently carry this bag and the
larger one together; and you will often see a woman with a big bag
heavily laden with vegetables or firewood or both, and another smaller
bag (perhaps also slung behind over the top of the big one, or hanging
from her head at her side, or over her breast), which contains her
baby, apparently rolled up into a ball. These bags also are uncoloured.
(3) There are other bags, similar perhaps in size to No. 2, used for
visiting and at feasts, dances and similar occasions, and also
sometimes used for carrying babies. The top line of one of these is
generally about 2 feet long, the bottom line a trifle longer, and the
side lines about 1 foot. These are coloured in decorative patterns. (4)
There <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3107" href="#xd26e3107" name=
"xd26e3107">74</a>]</span>are small bags of various sizes carried by
men slung over their shoulders or arms, and used to hold their
betel-nut, pepper and tobacco and various little implements and
utensils of daily life. These are sometimes uncoloured and sometimes
coloured. (5) There are the very small charm bags, only about 2 inches
or a trifle more square, which are used by both men and women (I think
only the married ones) for carrying charms, and are worn hanging like
lockets from the neck. They are sometimes coloured.</p>
<p>Plate <a href="#p053">53</a> gives illustrations of three of these
bags&mdash;Fig. 1 being a woman&rsquo;s ornamented bag No. 3, and Fig.
2 being a man&rsquo;s ornamented bag No. 4; but this last-mentioned bag
is rather a large one of its type, the usual difference in size between
Nos. 3 and 4 being greater than the two examples figured would suggest.
The patterns of both these bags, and especially of the larger one, are
more regular than is usually the case. The bag shown in Fig. 3 will be
dealt with hereafter under the heading of netting.</p>
<p>As regards women, the carrying of bags, either full or empty,
hanging over their backs is so common that one might almost regard the
bag as an additional article of dress. I may say here in advance of my
observations on netting that the distinctive features of Mafulu bags,
as compared with those made in Mekeo and on the coast, are the special
and peculiar form of netting which is commonly adopted for some of them
and the curious lines of colouring with which they are often
ornamented.</p>
<p>Hammocks are commonly used in the houses and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3119" href="#xd26e3119" name=
"xd26e3119">75</a>]</span><i>emone</i> for sleeping.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3123src" href="#xd26e3123" name="xd26e3123src">4</a> These
also are made of network and will be referred to later. The distinctive
feature of network mentioned in relation to bags applies to these also,
but not that of colouring.</p>
<p>Pottery is not made or used in Mafulu.</p>
<div class="figure floatRight fig02width" id="fig02"><img src=
"images/b075.gif" alt="Ancient Mortar." width="224" height="187">
<p class="figureHead">Ancient Mortar.</p>
</div>
<p>I may perhaps refer here to what I imagine to be an ancient stone
mortar, which I found at Mafulu, and which I have endeavoured to show
in Fig. 2. A portion of the upper part of the original was broken away,
and I regret that I did not try to sketch it just as it was, instead of
adopting the easier course of following what had been the original
lines. I am also sorry that its great weight made it impossible for me
to bring it down with me to the coast,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3134src" href="#xd26e3134" name="xd26e3134src">5</a> and that by
an oversight I did not secure a photograph of it. The vessel was well
and evenly shaped. It had perfectly smooth surfaces, without any trace
of cutting or chipping, and must have been made by grinding. It was
devoid of any trace of decoration. Its top external diameter was about
12 inches, its height, when standing upright on its base, was about 8
inches, and the thickness of the bowl at the lip <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3137" href="#xd26e3137" name=
"xd26e3137">76</a>]</span> about 1 inch. I was told that similar things
are from time to time found in the district, generally on the ridges,
far away from water. A Mafulu chief said that the Mafulu name for these
things is <i>idagafe.</i> The natives have no knowledge of their origin
or past use, the only explanation of the latter which was suggested
being that they were used as looking-glasses by looking into the scummy
surface of the water inside them.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3142src"
href="#xd26e3142" name="xd26e3142src">6</a></p>
<p>European things. The Mafulu people are now beginning, mainly through
the missionaries of the Sacred Heart, and also through their contact
with Mekeo and other lowland tribes, to get into touch with European
manufactures. Trade beads, knives, axes, plane irons (used by them in
place of stone blades for their adzes), matches and other things are
beginning to find their way directly and indirectly into such of the
villages as are nearest to the opportunities of procuring them by
exchange or labour.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Domestic Animals.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Dogs may occasionally, though only rarely, be seen in
the villages, but these are small black, brownish-black, or black and
white dogs with very bushy tails, and not the yellow dingo dogs which
infest the villages of Mekeo; and even these Mafulu dogs are, I was
told, not truly a Mafulu institution, having been obtained by the
people, I think, only recently from their Kuni neighbours. A tame
cockatoo may also <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3155" href=
"#xd26e3155" name="xd26e3155">77</a>]</span>very occasionally be seen,
and even, though still more rarely, a tame hornbill. There are no cocks
and hens.</p>
<p>The universal domestic animal of the Mafulu, however, is the pig,
and he is so important to them that he is worthy of notice. These pigs
are &ldquo;village&rdquo; pigs, which, though naturally identical with
&ldquo;wild&rdquo; pigs&mdash;being, in fact, wild pigs which have been
caught alive or their descendants&mdash;have to be distinguished from
wild pigs, and especially so in connection with feasts and
ceremonies.</p>
<p>Village pigs are the individual property of the householders who
possess them, there being no system of community or village ownership;
and, when required for feasts and ceremonies, each household has to
provide such pig or pigs as custom requires of it. They are bred in the
villages by their owners, and by them brought up, fed and tended, the
work of feeding and looking after them being the duty of the women. No
distinguishing ownership marks are put upon the pigs, but their owners
know their own pigs, and still more do the pigs know the people who
feed them; so that disputes as to ownership do not arise. The number of
pigs owned by these people is enormous in proportion to the size of
their villages, and I was told that a comparatively small village will
be able at a big feast to provide a number of village pigs much in
excess of what will be produced by one of the big Mekeo villages.</p>
<p>These village pigs often wander away into the bush, and may
disappear from sight for months; but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e3163" href="#xd26e3163" name="xd26e3163">78</a>]</span>they
nevertheless still continue to be village pigs. If, however, they are
not seen or heard of for a very long time (say six months), they are
regarded as having become wild pigs, and may be caught and appropriated
as such. It is usual with village pigs to clip or shorten their ears
and tails, or even sometimes to remove their eyes, so as to keep them
from wandering into the gardens.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3165src"
href="#xd26e3165" name="xd26e3165src">7</a> But even a village pig thus
marked as such would be regarded as having become a wild pig if it had
disappeared for a very long time.</p>
<p>Village pigs (as distinguished from wild pigs) are, as will be seen
below, never eaten in their own village on ceremonial occasions, or
indeed perhaps at all, being only killed and cut up and given to the
visitors to take away and eat in their own villages.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Etiquette.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These simple people do not appear to have many customs
which come under the heading of etiquette, pure and simple.</p>
<p>A boy must soon, say within a few weeks, after he has received his
perineal band leave the parental home, and go to live in the
<i>emone;</i> but this rule only refers to his general life, and does
not prohibit him from ever entering his parents&rsquo; house. If he
receives his band when he is very young, this rule will not begin to
operate until he is ten or twelve years old. He is in no case under any
prohibition from being in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3183"
href="#xd26e3183" name="xd26e3183">79</a>]</span>or crossing the
village enclosure. A girl is allowed to enter the <i>emone</i>, though
she may not sleep there, prior to receiving her band, but after that
she must never enter it.</p>
<p>A young unmarried man, who has arrived at the marriageable age, must
not eat in the presence of women. He can eat in the bush, or inside the
<i>emone</i>, but he must not eat on the platform of the <i>emone</i>,
where women might see him. There appear to be no other customs of
mutual avoidance, as, for example, that between son-in-law and
mother-in-law, and with reference to other marriage relationships, such
as are found in some of the Solomon Islands, and among various other
primitive races.</p>
<p>Children and unimportant adults must always pass behind a chief, not
in front of him, and when a chief is speaking, everyone else, old and
young, must be silent.</p>
<p>Young men and girls associate and talk freely together in public
among other people, but no young man would go about alone with a girl,
unless he was misconducting himself with her, or wished to do so.</p>
<p>Visiting is purely friendly and social, and there is no personal
system of formal and ceremonial visiting, except as between communities
or villages.</p>
<p>There do not appear to be any forms of physical salutation, but
there are recognised ways in which men address one another on meeting
and parting. If A and B meet in the bush, A may say to B, &ldquo;Where
do you come from?&rdquo;, and B will answer, &ldquo;I come
from&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; A may then say, &ldquo;Where are you
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3204" href="#xd26e3204" name=
"xd26e3204">80</a>]</span>going to?&rdquo;, and B will reply to this.
Then B may put similar questions to A, and will be similarly answered.
These questions are not necessarily asked because the questioner is
really anxious for information, but are in the nature of a
formality,&mdash;the equivalent of our &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; The
system of asking and answering these questions, though well recognised
as a social form, is not in practice strictly adhered to. Also A, on
coming to a village and finding B there, and wishing to salute him,
will call him by name, and B will then call A by name. Then A will say,
&ldquo;You are here,&rdquo; and B will reply, &ldquo;I am here.&rdquo;
This form is more strictly carried out than is the other one. Then when
A leaves he will say to B, &ldquo;I am going,&rdquo; and B will answer,
&ldquo;Go.&rdquo; Then B will call A by his name, and A will call B by
name, and the formality is finished. If A, being very friendly with B,
comes to his village to see him, on A&rsquo;s departure B, and probably
B&rsquo;s family, will accompany A out of the village, and will stand
watching his departure until he is about to disappear round the corner
of the path; and then they will call out his name, and he will respond
by calling out B&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Gestures may perhaps be included under this heading, though there is
apparently but little to be said about the matter. When a question is
asked, an affirmative reply is indicated by nodding the head, and a
negative one by shaking it; and, though I asked if this was not
probably the result of association with people who had been among white
men, I was told <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3208" href=
"#xd26e3208" name="xd26e3208">81</a>]</span>that it was not so. A
negative answer is also often expressed by shrugging the shoulders, and
a kind of grimace with the lips. The nodding of the head to a negative
question, such as &ldquo;Are you not well?&rdquo; signifies assent to
the negative, that is, that he is not well, and so vice-versa with the
shaking of the head. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3210" href=

<h3 class="main">Communities, Clans, and Villages.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The native populations of the Mafulu area are
scattered about in small groups or clusters of villages or hamlets;
and, as each cluster of villages is for many purposes a composite and
connected whole, I propose to call such a cluster a
&ldquo;community.&rdquo; Friendships, based on proximity and frequent
intercourse and intermarriage, doubtless arise between neighbouring
communities, but otherwise there does not appear to be any idea in the
minds of the people of any general relationship or common interest
between these various communities of the area. Each community regards
the members of every other community within the area as outsiders, just
as much so as are, say, the Ambo people to the north and the Kuni
people to the west. If a community, or group of communities together,
were the subject of an attack from either Ambo or Kuni natives, each of
these being people whose language is different&mdash;as regards the
Kuni utterly different&mdash;from that of the Mafulu, there would
apparently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3219" href="#xd26e3219"
name="xd26e3219">83</a>]</span>be no thought of other Mafulu-speaking
communities, as such, coming to assist in repelling the attack. Hence
in dealing with the question of inter-village relationship, I have to
fix my mind mainly upon the community and its constituent parts.</p>
<p>Concerning the situation as between one community and another, as
they regard themselves as quite distinct and unrelated, the only
question which seems to arise is that of the ownership of, and rights
over, the intervening bush and other land. The boundaries between what
is regarded as the preserve of one community, within which its members
may hunt and fish, clear for garden purposes, cut timber, and collect
fruit, and that of an adjoining community are perfectly well known. The
longitudinal boundaries along the valleys are almost always the rivers
and streams, which form good boundary marks; but those across the hills
and ridges from stream to stream are, I was told, equally defined in
the minds of the natives, though no artificial boundary marks are
visible. These boundaries are mutually respected, and trouble and
fighting over boundary and trespass questions are, I was told,
practically unknown, the people in this respect differing from those of
Mekeo.</p>
<p>A community comprises several villages, the number of which may vary
from, say, two to eight. But the relationship between all the villages
is not identical. There is a clan system, and there is generally more
than one clan in a community. Often there are three or more of such
clans. Each clan, however, has its own villages, or sometimes one
village only, within <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3225" href=
"#xd26e3225" name="xd26e3225">84</a>]</span>the community, and two
clans are never found represented in any one village,<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e3227src" href="#xd26e3227" name="xd26e3227src">1</a> or any
one clan spread over two or more communities.</p>
<p>Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of a typical Mafulu community,
the circles representing villages of one clan, the squares those of
another clan, and the triangle being the sole village of a third
clan.</p>

</div>
<p>I have said that the entire community is for many purposes a
composite whole. In many matters they act together as a community. This
is especially so as regards the big feast, which I shall describe
hereafter. It is so also to a large extent in some other ceremonies and
in the organisation of hunting and fishing parties and sometimes in
fighting. And the community as a whole has its boundaries, within which
are the general community rights of hunting, fishing, etc., as above
stated.</p>
<p>But the relationship between a group of villages of any one clan
within the community is of a much closer and more intimate character
than is that of the community as a whole. These villages of one clan
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3244" href="#xd26e3244" name=
"xd26e3244">85</a>]</span>have a common <i>amidi</i> or chief, a common
<i>emone</i> or clubhouse, and a practice of mutual support and help in
fighting for redress of injury to one or more of the individual
members; and there is a special social relationship between their
members, and in particular clan exogamy prevails with them, marriages
between people of the same clan, even though in different villages,
being reprobated almost as much as are marriages between people of the
same village.</p>
<p>The Mafulu word for village is <i>emi</i>, but there are no words
signifying the idea of a community of villages and that of a group of
villages belonging to the same clan within that community. As regards
the latter there is the word <i>imbele</i>, but this word is used to
express the intimate social relationship existing between the members
of a clan, and not to express the idea of an actual group of villages.
Communities and villages have geographical names. The name adopted for
a community will probably be the name of some adjoining river or ridge.
That adopted for a village will probably be the name of the exact crest
or spot on which it is placed, the minuteness of the geographical
nomenclature here being remarkable. Clan-groups of villages, forming
part of a community, have, as such, no geographical names, but a member
of one such group will distinguish himself from those of another group
by saying that he is a man of&mdash;&mdash;, giving the name of the
chief of the clan occupying the group.</p>
<p>I was assured that, when there are two or more villages of a clan
with a common chief and emone, they have originally been one village
which has split up, an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3262" href=
"#xd26e3262" name="xd26e3262">86</a>]</span>event which undoubtedly
does in fact take place; while on the other hand the several villages
of a clan, presumably the outcome of a previous splitting-up of a
single village, will sometimes amalgamate together into one village,
which thus becomes the only village of the clan. But two villages of
different clans could never amalgamate in this way. The following are
examples of these village changes:&mdash;</p>
<p>Near to the Mafulu Mission station is a community called Sivu, which
includes seven villages occupied by three clans, as follows<a class=

</div>
<p>Referring to these villages, in the year 1899 the clan now occupying
the four villages Voitele, Amalala, Kodo-Malabe and Motaligo had only a
single village, Kaidiabe, the clan&rsquo;s chief being the
above-mentioned Jaria. Then there was a Government punitive expedition,
following the attack of the natives upon Monseigneur de Boismenu (the
present Bishop of the Mission of the Sacred Heart in British New
Guinea) and his friends, who were making their first exploration of the
district, in which expedition a number of natives, including the
brother of the chief, were killed. After that the village was
abandoned, and the three villages of Voitele, Amalala and Motaligo
arose in its place. Subsequently after a big feast, which was held at
Amalala in the year 1909, that village put out an offshoot, which is
the present village of Kodo-Malabe. Also in the year 1909 the village
of Uvande was represented by seven villages, all belonging to one clan
under the chieftainship of Iu-Baibe, the names of which were Ipolo,
Olona, Isisibei, Valamenga, Amada, Angasabe and Amambu; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3334" href="#xd26e3334" name=
"xd26e3334">88</a>]</span>but after the feast above mentioned the
people of that clan all abandoned their villages, and joined together
in forming the present village of Uvande.</p>
<p>The chief, that is the true chief, of a clan has his house in one of
the villages of the clan, and if, as sometimes occurs, he has houses in
two or more of these villages, there is one village in which is what is
regarded as his usual residence, and this is the village in which is
the <i lang="xx">emone</i> of the clan.</p>
<p>As regards the relative predominance of the various clans of a
community and their respective chiefs in matters affecting the whole
community (<i>e.g.,</i> the arranging and holding of a big feast),
there is no rule or system. The predominance will probably, unless
there be a great disparity in the actual size or importance of the
clans, and perhaps even to a certain extent notwithstanding such a
disparity, fall to the clan whose chief by his superior ability or
courage or force of character, or perhaps capacity for palavering, has
succeeded in securing for himself a predominating influence in the
community.</p>
<p>The word <i lang="xx">imbele</i> and certain other words are used to
designate the closeness or otherwise of the connection between
individuals. <i lang="xx">Imbele</i> signifies the close connection
which exists between members of one clan, and a man will say of another
member of his clan that he is his <i lang="xx">imbele</i>. The word
<i>bilage</i> signifies a community connection, which is recognised as
being not so close as a clan connection; and a man will say of another,
who is outside his own clan, but is a member of his own community, that
he is his <i lang="xx">bilage</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e3364" href="#xd26e3364" name="xd26e3364">89</a>]</span>The
expression <i lang="xx">a-gata</i> signifies absence of any connection,
and a man will refer to a member of another community, Mafulu, Kuni,
Ambo, or anything else (there is no distinction between these in the
use of the term) as being <i lang="xx">a-gata</i>, thereby meaning that
he is an outsider.</p>
<p>This brings me to the question of the use by me of the term
&ldquo;clan&rdquo; to designate the intimate association above referred
to. To begin with, there is a considerable difference between the
situation produced by the clan system, if it may be regarded as such,
of Mafulu and that of, say, Mekeo, where one finds several clans
occupying one village, and where members of one clan may be scattered
over several more or less distant villages; though this latter
difference might perhaps arise in part from natural geographical
causes, the flat lowlands of the Mekeo people being highly favourable
to inter-village communication over their whole areas, and to the
holding of their recognised and numerous markets, whilst it may almost
be assumed that such intercommunication would be more restricted, at
all events in days gone by, among the Mafulu inhabitants of the
mountains.</p>
<p>Then again in Mafulu there are no clan badges, nor are there any
realistic or conventional representations of, or designs which can to
my mind be possibly regarded as representing, or having had their
origin in the representation of, animals, birds, fishes, plants, or
anything else. As regards this, however, it may be mentioned that the
Mafulu people are very primitive and undeveloped, and have not in their
art <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3376" href="#xd26e3376" name=
"xd26e3376">90</a>]</span>any designs which could readily partake of
this imitative character, their artistic efforts never producing
curves, and indeed not going beyond geometric designs composed of
straight lines, rectangular and zig-zag patterns and spots.</p>
<p>Also I was unable to discover the faintest trace of any idea which
might be regarded as being totemistic, or having a totemistic origin.
In particular, although enquiry was made from ten independent and
trustworthy native sources, I could not find a trace of any system of
general clan taboo against the killing or the eating of any animal,
bird, fish, or plant. It is true that there are various temporary food
taboos associated with special conditions and events, and that there
are certain things the eating of which is regarded as permanently taboo
to certain individuals; but the former of these restrictions are
general and are not associated with particular clans or communities,
and the latter restrictions relate separately to the individuals only,
and apparently are based in each case on the fact that the food has
been found to disagree with him; though whether the restriction is the
result of mere common sense based upon individual experience, or has in
it an element of superstition as to something which may be harmful to
the individual concerned, is a point upon which I could not get
satisfactory explanation.</p>
<p>Again, still dealing with the question of totemism, I may say that
the community and village names (as already stated, there are no clan
names) do not appear to be referable to any possible totemistic
objects. There <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3382" href=
"#xd26e3382" name="xd26e3382">91</a>]</span>is no specific ancestor
worship, in connection with which I could endeavour to trace out an
association between that ancestor and a totemistic object, and there is
no special reverence paid to any animal or vegetable, except certain
trees and creepers, the fear of which is associated with spirits and
ghosts generally, and not with ghosts of individual persons, and except
as regards omen superstitions concerning flying foxes and fireflies,
which are general and universal among all these people, and except as
regards the possible imitative character of the Mafulu dancing, which,
if existent, is probably also universal.</p>
<p>Moreover, I was told that now, at any rate, the people regard their
<i>imbele</i> or clan relationship as a social one, as well as one of
actual blood, a statement which is illustrated by the fact that, if a
member of one clan leaves his village to reside permanently in a
village of another clan, he will regard the members of the latter clan,
and will himself be regarded by them, as being <i>imbele</i>, although
he does not part with the continuing <i>imbele</i> connection between
himself and the other members of his original clan.</p>
<p>On the other hand the association between members of a clan is
exceedingly close, so much so that a serious injury done by an outsider
to one member of a clan (<i>e.g.</i>, his murder, or the case of his
wife eloping with a stranger and her family refusing to compensate him
for the price which he had paid for her on marriage) is taken up by the
entire clan, who will join the injured individual in full force to
inflict retribution; and, as already stated, the members of a clan
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3400" href="#xd26e3400" name=
"xd26e3400">92</a>]</span>share in one common chief and one common
<i>emone</i>, intermarriage between them is regarded as wrong, and
apparently each group of villages occupied by a single clan has in
origin been a single village, and may well have a common descent. I
think, therefore, that I am justified in regarding these internal
sections of a community as clans.</p>

"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Chiefs, Sub-Chiefs and Notables and Their Emone</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the head of each clan is the <i>amidi</i>, or chief
of the clan. He is, and is recognised as being, the only true
chief.</p>
<p>He is the most important personage of his clan, and is treated with
the respect due to his office; but, though he takes a leading part in
all matters affecting the clan, he is not a person with any
administrative or judicial functions, and he has no power of punishment
or control over the members of the clan. In public ceremonial matters
of importance, however, he has functions which rest primarily upon him
alone, and he does, in fact, always perform these functions in his own
village; and on the occasion of a big feast (as to which see below), he
does so in whatever village of the clan that feast may be held.</p>
<p>The chief lives in one of the villages of the clan, but may have
houses in other villages of that clan also. In the village in which he
mainly resides is his <i>emone</i> or club-house, which is the only
true <i>emone</i> of the clan; and for the upkeep and repair of this he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3423" href="#xd26e3423" name=
"xd26e3423">93</a>]</span>is responsible. This is the ceremonial
<i>emone</i> in his own village, and is always the one used in
connection with the ceremony of a big feast in any village of the clan;
and, if the feast be held in a village other than that in which is his
then existing <i>emone</i>, another one is built in that village in
lieu of his former one in the other village.</p>
<p>There is not in connection with these chiefs and their ceremonies
any distinctive difference in importance between the right and the left
as regards the positions occupied by them on the <i>emone</i> platform
or the structure of the <i>emone</i>, such as is found among the Roro
people.</p>
<p>Next in rank to the chief, and at the head of each village of the
clan, there is a sub-chief, or <i>em&rsquo; u babe</i>, this term
meaning &ldquo;father of the village.&rdquo; He is not regarded as a
true chief, but he is entitled, and it is his duty, to perform in his
own village all the functions of the chief, except those connected with
the big feast. He and the similar sub-chiefs of the other villages of
the clan are the persons who take the prominent part in supporting the
chief in any ceremonial function concerning the whole clan in which the
latter may be engaged, and in particular at the big feast. The
<i>em&rsquo; u babe</i> is usually a relative of the chief, and at all
events is an important personage. He also has in his own village his
<i>emone</i>, which is the principal <i>emone</i> of that village, and
is used for all ceremonial functions in that village except the big
feast, but it is not regarded as being a true <i>emone</i>. The chief
holds in his own village of residence both <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3457" href="#xd26e3457" name=
"xd26e3457">94</a>]</span>his office of <i>amidi</i> and that of
<i>em&rsquo; u babe</i>, there being no other person holding the latter
office in that village.</p>
<p>Next in rank to the sub-chiefs come a number of <i>ake baibe</i>,
which means &ldquo;great men.&rdquo; These are the leading
people&mdash;the aristocracy&mdash;of the clan. There are no
distinctive social grades of rank among them. Their number is often
very large in proportion to the total number of male inhabitants of a
village; indeed sometimes almost every member of a village will claim
to belong to this class. These people are in no sense office-bearers,
and have no special duties to perform, though on a ceremonial occasion
they are entitled to have their importance borne in mind. Each of them
also is entitled to have an <i>emone</i> (here again not a true
<i>emone</i>) in his village, but in fact their numbers often make this
practically impossible, and you rarely see more than two or three
<i>emone</i> in one village.</p>
<p>The above are all the chiefs and notables of the clan. There is no
such thing as a war chief.</p>
<p>Aristocracy in its various forms is not a condition to which a man
attains on getting older&mdash;it is attained by inheritance.</p>
<p>The office of the chief is hereditary in the male line by strict
rules of descent and primogeniture. On the death of a chief his office
descends to his eldest son, or if that son has died leaving children,
it descends to the eldest son of that son, and so on for subsequent
generations. Failing the eldest son or male issue in the male line of
the eldest son, the office devolves upon the late chiefs second son or
his male issue in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3485" href=
"#xd26e3485" name="xd26e3485">95</a>]</span>male line. And so on for
other sons and their issue. Failing such male issue the office passes
to a collateral relation of the late chief on his father&rsquo;s side
(<i>e.g.</i>, the late chief&rsquo;s next eldest brother or that
brother&rsquo;s son, or the late chief&rsquo;s second brother or that
brother&rsquo;s son), the ascertainment of the devolution being based
upon a general principle of nearest male relationship in the male line
and primogeniture.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3490src" href=
"#xd26e3490" name="xd26e3490src">3</a></p>
<p>The chief holds his office for life, but he may in his lifetime
resign it in favour of the person entitled to succeed him, and this in
fact often occurs. He cannot, however, on the appointment of his
successor still continue in office himself, so as to create a joint
chieftainship, as is done in Mekeo. He, as chief, is subject to no
special taboo, and there is no qualification for office, other, of
course, than hereditary right; but no chief can perform the functions
of his office, or build for himself an <i lang="xx">emone</i>, until he
has married. There is no ceremony on the chiefs accession to office on
the death of his predecessor; but there is a ceremony (to be described
hereafter) on a chief&rsquo;s abdication in favour of his successor.
Cases have, I was told, occurred in which a man has in one way or
another forced himself into the position of chief, though not qualified
by descent, and has thus become a chief, from whom subsequent
chieftainship descent has been traced, but I could learn nothing of the
circumstances <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3501" href=
"#xd26e3501" name="xd26e3501">96</a>]</span>under which this had
occurred. Also it has happened that, when a chief has been weak, and
has not asserted his position, a sub-chief has more or less usurped his
power and influence, without actually upsetting his chieftainship or
supplanting him in his performance of ceremonial duties.</p>
<p>If the chief on acquiring office by inheritance is a child, or not
qualified to act (<i>e.g.</i>, unmarried), he is nevertheless chief;
but some person will usually act as his guardian, and perform his
functions for him until he has qualified. This person will probably be
one of the young chief&rsquo;s eldest male paternal relations
(<i>e.g.</i>, the eldest living brother of the last previous chief),
and will presumably be a person of consequence; but he will not
necessarily be one of the sub-chiefs.</p>
<p>All the above observations concerning the hereditary nature of a
chief&rsquo;s office and subsequently explained matters apply also to
the case of a sub-chief, except that there is no ceremony on his
resigning office in favour of his successor, and that the usurpation of
the office of a sub-chief, of the occurrence of which I found no
record, would perhaps be more difficult of accomplishment. In the event
of a village throwing off an offshoot village, or itself splitting up
into two villages, the then existing sub-chief of the original village
would continue his office in it or, in case of a division, in one of
the villages resulting from the split, and the other village would have
for its sub-chief some one of the <i lang="xx">ake-baibe</i> of the
original village, probably the one who was most active in organising
the split. On the other hand, if several villages united into one, one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3517" href="#xd26e3517" name=
"xd26e3517">97</a>]</span>only of their sub-chiefs could be sub-chief
of the village arising from the amalgamation, and the others would sink
to the rank of <i lang="xx">ake-baibe</i>.</p>
<p>The observations concerning the hereditary nature of a chiefs rank
also apply to the <i lang="xx">ake-baibe</i>. I have no information
concerning them on the other points; but these are not so important as
regards these people, who have no official position and have no duties
to perform.</p>
<p>There are, as will be seen hereafter, a number of persons who are
employed from time to time to perform various acts and functions of a
ceremonious or superstitious character, notably the man who has the
important duty of killing pigs at feasts; but these men are not by
virtue of their offices or functions either chiefs or sub-chiefs, or
even notables or important personages. It is in each case a matter of
the specific personal power which the man is believed to possess. Any
of them might happen to be an important personage, and the pig-killer,
whose office is a prominent one, would probably be one; though in his
case muscular strength would, I understand, be an important element of
qualification.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3529src" href="#xd26e3529"

<h3 class="main">Villages and Their Emone and Houses.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Mafulu villages are generally situated on narrow
plateaux or ridges, sloping down on each side; but the plateaux are not
usually so narrow, nor the slopes so steep, as are those of the Kuni
district, and the villages themselves are not generally so narrow, as
the contour of the country does not involve these conditions to the
same extent. Also the Mafulu villages are on the lower ridges only, and
not on the high mountains; but the actual elevations above sea-level of
these lower ridges are, I think, generally higher than those of the top
ridges of the Kuni. Plate <a href="#p054">54</a> shows the position and
surroundings of the village of Salube (community of Auga), and is a
good representative example, except that the plate does not show any
open grassland.</p>
<p>The villages are, or were, protected with stockades and with pits
outside the stockades, and sometimes with platforms on trees near the
stockade boundaries, from which platforms the inhabitants can shoot and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3555" href="#xd26e3555" name=
"xd26e3555">99</a>]</span>hurl stones upon an enemy climbing up the
slope. The stockade is made of timber, is about 15 to 25 feet high, and
is generally constructed in three or more parallel rows or lines, each
of the lines having openings, but the openings never being opposite to
one another. These protections have now, however, been largely, though
not entirely, discontinued.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3557src" href=
"#xd26e3557" name="xd26e3557src">1</a> It is, or was, also the
practice, when expecting an attack, to put into the ground in the
approaches to the village calthrop-like arrow-headed objects, with
their points projecting upwards.</p>
<p>The average size of the villages is small compared with that of the
large villages of Mekeo, some of them having only six or eight houses,
though many villages have thirty houses, and some of them have fifty or
sixty or more. The houses and <i>emone</i> are much smaller than those
of Mekeo, and much ruder and simpler in construction and they have no
carving or other decoration. There are no communal houses.</p>
<p>The houses are ranged in two parallel rows along the side of the
ridge, with an open village space between them, the space being
considerably longer than it is broad, and more or less irregular in
shape. The houses are generally built with their door-openings facing
inwards towards the village enclosure.</p>
<p>At one end of the village, and facing down the open space, is the
chief&rsquo;s or sub-chief&rsquo;s <i>emone</i>. These are, like the
Roro <i>marea</i> and the Mekeo <i>ufu</i>, used, not only in
connection with ceremonies, but also as living houses <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3578" href="#xd26e3578" name=
"xd26e3578">100</a>]</span>for men, especially unmarried men, and for
the accommodation of visitors to the village. There are probably also
in the village the <i>emone</i> of one or more of the notables before
mentioned, of which one will be at the other end of the village and any
others will be among the houses at the side of, and facing into, the
village enclosure. There are not often more than three <i>emone</i>,
true or otherwise, in one village.</p>
<p>You of course do not find the surrounding palm groves of Mekeo and
the coast; nor do you generally see the waste space behind the houses,
or the ring of garden plots outside the waste space, the position of
the village on its ridge being usually hardly adapted to the latter.
You may, however, often find garden plots very near to the village.
Each family has its own house, and, except as regards the <i>emone</i>
and their use, there are no separate houses for men or women, or for
any class of them.</p>
<p>The Mafulu <i>emone</i> is an oblong building, erected on piles of
very varying height, the interior floor being anything from 3 to 15
feet above the ground. In size also it varies very much, but generally
it is internally about 12 to 15 feet long from front to back, and about
8 to 12 feet in width. The roof, which is thatched with long, rather
broad leaves, is constructed on the ridge and gable principle, with the
gable ends facing the front and the back, and the roof sloping on both
sides in convex curves from the ridge downwards. Remarkable and
specially distinctive features of the building are the thatched roof
appendages projecting from the tops of the two gable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3597" href="#xd26e3597" name=
"xd26e3597">101</a>]</span>ends (front and back), the forms of which
appendages are somewhat like a hood or the convex fan-shaped
semicircular roof of an apse, and in construction are sometimes made as
rounded overhanging continuations of the upper part of the roof, and
sometimes as independent additions, not continuous with, and not
forming parts of, the actual roof. In front of the building, but not at
the back, is a platform at a level about a foot below that of the inner
floor, extending the whole length of the front of the building, and
projecting forwards to a distance of from 2 to 5 feet. The approach
from the ground to this platform in the case of a high-built emone is a
rudely constructed ladder, but when the building is only low and near
the ground it is generally merely a rough sloping piece of tree trunk,
or even only a stump. The two gable ends are enclosed with walls made
of horizontal tree branches, two or three of which are, at both the
front and rear ends of the building, discontinued for a short distance
in the centre, so as to leave openings. These openings are, say, 2 feet
or more above the level of the front outside platform, and 1 foot or
more above that of the inside floor, and are usually very small; so
that, in entering or leaving the building, you have to step up to, or
even climb, and wriggle yourself through the opening, and then step
down on the other side. Inside the building you find the centre of the
floor space occupied by a longitudinal fireplace, about 2 feet broad,
extending from front to back of the building; and the floors on each
side of this fireplace slope upwards somewhat from the visible level of
the fire-place <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3599" href=
"#xd26e3599" name="xd26e3599">102</a>]</span>towards the sides of the
building. The fireplace part of the interior is, in fact, dropped to a
level below that of the adjoining floors, so as to form a long trough,
which is filled up with soil upon which the fire can burn; and it is
the visible top level of this soil covering which is practically flush
with the inside lower level of the adjacent upward-sloping floors. Some
distance below the roof there is usually an open ceiling of reeds, used
for the purpose of storing and drying fruits and other things, and
especially, as will be seen hereafter, for drying fruit required in the
preparation for the big feast.</p>

<p><a href="#fig05">Fig. 5</a> is a diagram of a transverse section
across the centre of an <i>emone</i>, showing the internal
construction. The explanatory note only deals with portions not
explained in those to <a href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>. <span class=

<p><i>Explanatory Note to Fig.</i> 5.</p>
<p>Post <i>a</i> is the main central support of the building
corresponding with post <i>a</i> in Fig. 4. Posts <i>b b</i> are
central side supports to the roof. Poles <i>c</i> and <i>d</i> are
attached to posts <i>a b b</i>, and help to strengthen the fabric.
These poles are also used for hanging up sleeping hammocks, the other
extremities of which are hung to the <i lang="xx">loko-loko</i> of the
roof (<a href="#fig04">Fig. 4</a>, <i>f</i>). The name for post
<i>a</i> is <i>dudu</i>, but this word is often used to express the
whole structure <i>a b b c d</i>.</p>
<p>I have endeavoured in the diagrammatic sketch&mdash;Fig. 6&mdash;to
illustrate the apse-like projection of the roof of an <i lang=
"xx">emone</i> and the platform arrangements. I have in this sketch
denuded the apse roof of its thatch, showing it in skeleton only; and I
have shaded all timber work behind the platform, in order more clearly
to define the latter.</p>
<p><i>Explanatory Notes to Fig.</i> 6.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) Front end of thatch (<i lang="xx">asase</i>) of main
roof.</p>
<p>(<i>b c d</i>) Front apse-shaped roof (<i lang="xx">siafele</i>),
the thatch having been removed to show its internal construction.</p>
<p>(<i>b c, b e, b d</i>) Downward-sloping roof work (<i lang=
"xx">engala</i>).</p>
<p>(<i>f f, c d</i>] Horizontal roof work (<i lang="xx">gegebe</i>),
carried round in curves.</p>
<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Sometimes the apse-shaped roof is constructed as
a continuation of the main roof of the building, in which case the
<i lang="xx">gegebe</i> of the former are a continuation of those of
the latter. Sometimes the apse roof is a separate appendage, not
connected with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e3990" href=
"#xd26e3990" name="xd26e3990">107</a>]</span>the main roof, and in that
case the <i lang="xx">gegebe</i> of the former are separate from those
of the latter, and are fixed at their extremities to the <i lang=

<p>(<i>g</i>) Posts supporting the platform (<i>purum&rsquo;-ul&rsquo;
emuge</i>).</p>
<p>(<i>h</i>) Horizontal platform supports resting at one end on
<i>g</i> and at the other end fixed to either the <i>tedele</i> or the

<p>(<i>i</i>) Platform (<i>purume</i>).</p>
<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;It will be seen that the front <i lang=

<p>(<i>k</i>) Additional supports to the apse roof, which are sometimes
added, but are not usual. Their lower ends rest on the platform and
they are connected with the apse roof at its outer edge (Mafulu name
unknown).</p>
<p>(<i>l</i>) A stump by which to get on to the platform. This is often
a rough sloping piece of tree-trunk; where the platform of the emone is
high it is a rudely constructed ladder (<i lang="xx">gigide</i>).</p>
<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The entire fa&ccedil;ade of the front gable end
is called <i lang="xx">konimbe</i> (which means door) or <i lang=
"xx">purume</i> (which means platform). That of the back gable end is
called <i lang="xx">apei</i>.</p>
<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;The height of the door-opening above the outside
platform is shown in this figure.</p>
<p>The houses are in construction very similar to the <i lang=
"xx">emone</i>, and in fact the above description of the latter may be
taken as a description of a house, subject to the following
modifications: (i.) The house is never raised high, its floor always
being within a foot or two of the ground, (ii.) It is smaller than the
<i lang="xx">emone</i>, its average internal dimensions being about 8
to 12 feet long, and 8 to 10 feet wide, (iii.) The roof generally
slopes down on both sides to the level of the ground (concealing the
side structure of the house) or nearly so. (iv.) The projecting hood of
the roof is only added at the front of the building, and not at the
rear; and it is usually separate from, and not continuous with, the
real roof.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4080src" href="#xd26e4080" name=
"xd26e4080src">2</a> (v.) The platform is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4085" href="#xd26e4085" name="xd26e4085">109</a>]</span>generally
small and narrow, and often only extends for half the length of the
front of the house, and, being always within a foot or two of the
ground, it does not possess or require a ladder or tree-trunk approach;
it is also narrower. Frequently there is no platform at all. (vi.)
There is no entrance opening at the back of the house, (vii.) The front
entrance opening is smaller and narrower and more difficult of entry.
When the family are absent, they generally put sticks across this
opening to bar entry, whereas the entrance opening of the <i lang=
"xx">emone</i> is always open, (viii.) The centre house support very
often consists of one post only, instead of a combination, (ix.) There
is often on one side of the entrance opening a small space of the
inside of the house fenced off for occupation by the pigs, and there is
a little aperture by which they can get into this space from outside,
(x.) The <i lang="xx">avale</i> ceiling is usually absent; and, even if
there be one, it will only extend under a small portion of the
roof.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4094src" href="#xd26e4094" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The native paths of the Mafulu people, or at all
events those passing through forests, are, like those of most other
mountain natives, usually difficult for white men to traverse. The
forest tracks in particular are often quite unrecognisable as such to
an inexperienced white man, and are generally very narrow and beset
with a tangle of stems and hanging roots and creepers of the trees and
bush undergrowth, which catch the unwary traveller across the legs or
body or hands or face at every turn, and are often so concealed by the
grass and vegetation that, unless he be very careful, he is apt to be
constantly tripped up by them; and moreover these entanglements are
often armed with thorns or prickles, or have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4212" href="#xd26e4212" name=
"xd26e4212">111</a>]</span>serrated edges, a sweep of which may tear
the traveller&rsquo;s clothes, or lacerate his hands or face. Then
there are at every turn and corner rough trunks of fallen trees,
visible or concealed, often more or less rotten and treacherous, to be
got over; and such things are frequently the only means of crossing
ditches and ravines of black rotting vegetable mud. Moreover the paths
are often very steep; and, indeed, it is this fact, and the presence of
rough stones and roots, which renders the very prominent outward turn
of the people&rsquo;s big toes, with their prehensile power, such
useful physical attributes.</p>
<p>Their bridges may be divided into four types, namely: (1) A single
tree thrown across the stream, having either been blown down, and so
fallen across it accidentally, or been purposely placed across it by
the natives. (2) Two or more such trunks placed in parallel lines
across the stream, and covered with a rough platform of transverse
pieces of wood. (3) The suspension bridge. I regret that I am unable to
give a detailed description of Mafulu suspension bridges, but I think I
am correct in saying that they are very similar to those of the Kuni
people, one of whose bridges is described in the <i>Annual Report</i>
for June, 1909, as being 150 feet long and 20 feet above water at the
lowest part, and as being made of lawyer vine (I do not know whether
this would be right for Mafulu), with flooring of pieces of stick
supported on strips of bark, and as presenting a crazy appearance,
which made the Governor&rsquo;s carriers afraid of crossing it, though
it was in fact perfectly safe, and had very little <span class=

form of suspension bridge used by them, and adapted to narrower rivers,
the river in this case being the Aduala. (4) The bamboo bridge. This is
a highly arched bridge of bamboo stems. The people take two long stems,
and splice them together at their narrow ends, the total length of the
spliced pair being considerably greater than the width of the river to
be bridged. They then place the spliced pair of bamboos across the
river, with one end against a strong backing and support on one side of
the river and the other end at the other side, where it will extend for
some little distance beyond the river bank. This further end is then
forcibly bent backward to the bank by a number of men working together,
and is there fixed and backed. The bamboo stems then form a high arch
over the river. They then fix another pair of stems in the same way,
close to and parallel with the first one; and the double arch so formed
is connected all the way across with short pieces of wood, tied firmly
to the stems, so as to strengthen the bridge and form a footway, by
which it can be crossed. They then generally add a hand rail on one
side. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4237" href="#xd26e4237" name=

<p>One can hardly leave the question of physical communications without
also referring to the marvellous system of verbal communication which
exists amongst the Mafulu and Kuni and other mountain people. Messages
are shouted across the valleys from village to village in a way which
to the unaccustomed traveller is amazing. It never seemed to me that
any attempt was made specially to articulate the words and syllables of
the message, or to repeat them slowly, so as to make them more readily
heard at a distance off, though the last syllable of each sentence is
always prolonged into a continuous sort of wail. This system of
wireless telegraphy has, however, been before described by other
writers, so I need say no more about it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

the elliptical houses to which he refers have probably been Kuni
houses, to which his description could well be applied, and that the
oblong houses have been Mafulu. The villages with very narrow streets,

<h3 class="main">Government and Justice.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is, as might be expected, no organised system of
government among the Mafulu, nor is there any official administration
of justice.</p>
<p>As regards government, the chiefs in informal consultation with the
sub-chiefs and prominent personages deal with important questions
affecting the community or clan or village as a whole, such as the
holding of big feasts and important ceremonies, the migrations or
splitting-up or amalgamation of villages, and warlike operations; but
events of this character are not frequent. And as to justice, neither
the chiefs nor any other persons have any official duties of settling
personal disputes or trying or punishing wrongdoers. The active
functions of the chiefs, in fact, appear to be largely ceremonial.</p>
<p>Concerning the question of justice, it would seem, indeed, that a
judicial system is hardly requisite. Personal disputes between members
of a village or clan, or even of a community, on such possible subjects
as inheritance, boundary, ownership of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4253" href="#xd26e4253" name="xd26e4253">115</a>]</span>property,
trespass and the like, and wrongful acts within the village or the
community, are exceedingly rare, except as regards adultery and
wounding and killing cases arising from acts of adultery, which are
more common.</p>
<p>There are certain things which from immemorial custom are regarded
as being wrong, and appropriate punishments for which are generally
recognised, especially stealing, wounding, killing and adultery; but
the punishment for these is administered by the injured parties and
their friends, favoured and supported by public opinion, and often,
where the offender belongs to another clan, actively helped by the
whole clan of the injured parties.</p>
<p>The penalty for stealing is the return or replacement of the article
stolen; but stealing within the community, and perhaps even more so
within the clan or village, is regarded as such a disgraceful offence,
more so, I believe, than either killing or adultery, that its mere
discovery involves a distressing punishment to the offender. As regards
wounding and killing, the recognised rule is blood for blood, and a
life for a life. The recognised code for adultery will be stated in the
<a href="#ch10">chapter on matrimonial matters</a>.</p>
<p>Any retribution for a serious offence committed by someone outside
the clan of the person injured is often directed, not only against the
offender himself, but against his whole clan.</p>
<p>There is a method of discovering the whereabouts of a stolen
article, and the identity of the thief, through the medium of a man who
is believed to have special <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4266"
href="#xd26e4266" name="xd26e4266">116</a>]</span>powers of
ascertaining them. This man takes one of the large broad single-shell
arm ornaments, which he places on its edge on the ground, and one of
the pig-bone implements already described, which he places standing on
its point upon the convex surface of the shell. To make the implement
stand in this way he puts on the point, and makes to adhere to the
shell a small piece of wild bees&rsquo; wax, this being done, I was
told, surreptitiously, though I cannot say to what extent the people
are deceived by the dodge, or are aware of it. The implement stands on
the shell for a few seconds, after which it falls down. Previously to
doing this he has told his client of certain possible directions in
which the implement may fall, and intimated that, whichever that may
be, it will be the direction in which the lost article must be sought.
He has also given certain alternative names of possible culprits, one
of such names being associated with each of the alternative directions
of falling. The fall of the implement thus indicates the quarter in
which the lost article may be found and the name of the thief. Father
Clauser saw this performance enacted in connection with a pig which had
been stolen from a chief; the falling bone successfully pointed to the
direction in which the pig was afterwards found, and there was no doubt
that the alleged thief was in fact the true culprit. Presumably the
operator makes private enquiries before trying his experiment, and
knows how to control the fall of the implement. <span class=

<h3 class="main">Property and Inheritance.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The property of a Mafulu native may be classified as
being (1) his movable belongings, such as clothing, ornaments,
implements and pigs; (2) his house in the village; (3) his bush land;
(4) his gardens.</p>
<p>The movable belongings are, of course, his own absolute
property.</p>
<p>The village house is also his own; but this does not include the
site of that house, which continues to be the property of the village.
Every grown-up male inhabitant of the village has the right to build
for himself one house in that village; he is not entitled to have more
than one there, but he may have a house in each of two or more
villages, and a chief or very important man is allowed two or three
houses in the same village. On a house being pulled down and not
rebuilt, or being abandoned and left to decay, the site reverts to the
village, and another person may build a house upon it.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4278src" href="#xd26e4278" name="xd26e4278src">1</a>
Houses are never sold, but the ordinary life of a house is only a few
years.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s bush land is his own property, and his ownership
includes all trees and growth which may be upon it, and which no other
man may cut down, but it does not include game, this being the common
property of the community; and any member of the community is entitled
to pass over the land, hunt on it, and fish in streams passing through
it, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4286" href="#xd26e4286" name=
"xd26e4286">118</a>]</span>he pleases. The whole of the bush land of
the community belongs in separate portions to different owners, one man
sometimes owning two or more of such portions; and it is most
remarkable that, though there are apparently no artificial boundary
marks between the various portions, these boundaries are, somehow or
other, known and respected, and disputes with reference to them are
practically unknown. How the original allocations and allotments of
land have been made does not appear to be known to the people
themselves.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s garden plot or plots are also his own, having been
cleared by him or some predecessor of his out of his or that
predecessor&rsquo;s own bush land; and he may build in his gardens as
many houses as he pleases. His ownership of his garden plot is more
exclusive than is that of his bush land, as other people are not
entitled to pass over it. But on the other hand, if he abandons the
garden, and nature again overruns it with growth&mdash;a process which
takes place with great rapidity&mdash;it ceases to be his garden, and
reverts to, and becomes absorbed in, the portion of the bush out of
which it had been cleared; and if, as it may be, he is not the sole
owner of that portion of bush, he loses his exclusive right to the
land, which as a garden had been his own sole property.</p>
<p>No man can sell or exchange either his bush land or his garden
plots, and changes in their ownership therefore only arise through
death and inheritance. This statement, however, is, I think, subject to
the qualification that an owner of bush-land will sometimes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4292" href="#xd26e4292" name=
"xd26e4292">119</a>]</span>allow his son or other male descendant to
clear and make for himself a garden in it; but I am not sure as to the
point.</p>
<p>On a man&rsquo;s death his widow, if any, does not inherit any
portion of his property, either movable or immovable, but three things
are allowed to her. She is generally allowed one pig, which will be
required by her at a later date for the ceremony of the removal of her
mourning; and she shares with her husband&rsquo;s children, or, if
there be none, she has the sole right to, the then current
season&rsquo;s crops and fruit resulting from the planting effected by
her late husband and herself, though this is a right which, after her
return home to her own people, she would not continue to exercise; and
she is allowed to continue to occupy her husband&rsquo;s house, but
this latter privilege terminates at the mourning removal ceremony, when
the house will be pulled down, and its site will revert to the village,
and she will probably return to her own people in her own village, if
she has not done so previously.</p>
<p>Subject to these three allowances, I may dismiss the widow entirely
in dealing with the law of inheritance. I may also dismiss the
man&rsquo;s female children by saying that, if there be male children,
the females do not share at all in the inheritance, and even if there
be no male children the female children will only perhaps be allowed,
apparently rather as a matter of grace than of right, to share in his
movable effects; and that, subject to this, everything goes to the
man&rsquo;s male relatives. I may also eliminate the man&rsquo;s pigs,
as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4298" href="#xd26e4298" name=
"xd26e4298">120</a>]</span>apparently any pigs he has, other than that
retained for his widow, are killed at his funeral.</p>
<p>On the death of an owner everything he possesses goes, except as
above mentioned, to his sons. They divide the movable things between
them, but the bush and garden land pass to them jointly, and there is
no process by which either of these can be divided and portioned among
them. The male children of a deceased son, and the male children of any
deceased male child of that deceased son (and so on for subsequent
generations), inherit between them in lieu of that son. There does not
appear, however, to be any idea in the Mafulu mind of each son of the
deceased owner being entitled to a specific equal fractional share, or
of the descendants of a deceased son of that owner being between them
only entitled to one share, <i>per stirpes</i>. They apparently do not
get beyond the general idea that these people, whoever they may be and
to whatever generations they may belong, become the owners of the
property.</p>
<p>They take possession of and cultivate the existing gardens as joint
property. Any one of them will be allowed to clear some of their
portion of bush, and fence it, and plant it as a garden, and it will
then become the sole property of that one man, and if he dies it will
pass as his own property to his own heirs; though, as before stated, if
he abandons it, and lets it be swallowed up by the bush, it will cease
to be his own garden, and will again be included in the family&rsquo;s
joint portion of bush land, and on his death his heirs will only come
into the joint bush ownership. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4307"
href="#xd26e4307" name="xd26e4307">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>In this way the ownership of a garden must often be in several
persons, with no well-defined rights <i>inter se</i>, and the general
ownership of bush land which has never been cleared, or which, having
been cleared, has been abandoned and reverted, must often be in a very
large number of persons without defined rights. In fact, so far as bush
land is concerned, one only has to remember that on the death of an
owner it passes into joint ownership of children&mdash;that on the
deaths of these children fresh groups of persons come into the joint
ownership&mdash;that this may go on indefinitely, generation after
generation&mdash;that bush, having once got into the ownership of many
people, is hardly likely to again fall by descents into a single
ownership&mdash;that indeed the tendency must be for the number of
owners of any one portion of bush steadily to increase&mdash;and
finally that there is no way by which the extensively divided ownership
can be terminated by either partition or alienation&mdash;and one then
realises the extraordinary complications of family ownership of bush
land which must commonly exist.</p>
<p>As regards both movable effects and gardens and bush land there must
be endless occasions for dispute. How are the movable things to be
divided among the inheritors, and, in particular, who is to take
perhaps one valuable article, which may be worth all the rest put
together? How are questions of doubtful claims to heirship to bush and
garden land to be determined? How is the joint ownership of the gardens
to be dealt with, and how is the work there to be apportioned, and the
products of the gardens <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4316" href=
"#xd26e4316" name="xd26e4316">122</a>]</span>divided? How are the
mutual rights of the bush land to be regulated, and especially what is
to happen if each of two or more joint owners desires to clear and
allocate to himself as a garden, a specially eligible piece of bush?
Such situations in England would bristle with lawsuits, and I tried to
find out how these questions were actually dealt with by the Mafulu;
but there is no judicial system there, and the only answer I could get
was that in these matters, as in the case of inter-community bush
boundaries and personal bush boundaries, disputes were practically
unknown; though it was pointed out to me, as regards bush land, that
the amount of it belonging to any one family was usually so large that
crowding out could hardly arise.</p>
<p>If a man dies without male descendants in the male line, then,
subject perhaps to some sort of claim of his daughters, if any, to
share in his movable effects, his property goes to his nearest male
relative or relatives in the male line. This would primarily be his
father, if living, but the father could hardly be the inheritor of
anything but movable things and perhaps garden land, as the deceased
could not be the owner of bush land during the lifetime of his father.
Subject as regards movable things and perhaps gardens to this right of
the father, the persons to inherit everything would be deceased&rsquo;s
brothers and the male descendants in the male line of any such brothers
who had died; or in default of these it would be the father&rsquo;s
(not the mother&rsquo;s) brothers and their male descendants in the
male line, and so on for more distant male relatives, every descent
being traced <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4320" href="#xd26e4320"
name="xd26e4320">123</a>]</span>strictly in the male line only, on a
principle similar to that above explained.</p>
<p>Male infants, by which term I mean young children, there being of
course no infancy in the defined sense in which the term is used in
English law, like adults, may become possessed of property by
inheritance as regards bush and garden land, and by inheritance or
otherwise as regards movable property, but they would hardly be likely
to be the owners of houses; and the descent from these infants is the
same as that in the case of adults.</p>
<p>No woman can possess any property, other than movable property, and
even this is at best confined to the clothes and ornaments which she
wears. On the death of a married woman all her effects go to her
husband, or, if he be dead, they go to her children or descendants,
male and female, equally, If she has no children or descendants, they
go to her husband&rsquo;s father, or, failing him, to such other person
or persons as would have been entitled to inherit if her effects had
been those of her husband. Her own blood relations do not come in, as
she had been bought and paid for by her husband. If the deceased woman
were a spinster, then her effects would pass to her father, or, failing
him, to her brothers, or, failing them, to her nearest male relatives
on her father&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>The guardianship of and responsibility for infant children whose
father dies falls primarily upon the children&rsquo;s mother, and she,
if and when she returned to her own people, would probably take the
children away with her, though her sons, who shared in the inheritance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4328" href="#xd26e4328" name=
"xd26e4328">124</a>]</span>from their father, would usually come back
again to their own village when they became grown up, and might do so
even when comparatively young. If there is no mother of the children,
the guardianship and responsibility is taken up by one or more of the
relatives of either the deceased father or deceased mother of the
children, and it might be that some children would be taken over by
some of such relatives, and some by others. There appears, however, to
be no regular rule as to all this, the question being largely one of
convenience.</p>
<p>Adopted children have in all matters of inheritance the same rights
as actual children.</p>
<p>From the above particulars it will be seen that there is no system
of descent in the female line or of mother-right among the Mafulu, and
I could not find any trace of such a thing having ever existed with
them. As to this I would draw attention to the facts that the
mother&rsquo;s relatives do not come in specially, as they do among the
Roro and Mekeo people, in connection with the perineal band ceremony;
that a boy owes no service to his maternal uncle, as is the case among
the Koita; that there is no equivalent of the Koita <i lang=
"xx">Heni</i> ceremony; that in no case can a woman be a chief, or
chieftainship descend by the female line; that children belong to the
clan of their father, and not to that of their mother; and that no duty
or responsibility for orphan children devolves specially upon their
mother&rsquo;s relations. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4337"

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">The Big Feast</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is the greatest and most important social
function of a Mafulu community of villages. I was unable to get any
information as to its real intent and origin, but a clue to this may, I
think, be found in the formal cutting down of the grave platform of a
chief, the dipping of chiefs&rsquo; bones in the blood of the slain
pigs, and the touching of other chiefs&rsquo; bones with the bones so
dipped, which constitute such important features of the function, and
which perhaps point to an idea of in some way finally propitiating or
driving away or &ldquo;laying&rdquo; the ghosts of the chiefs whose
bones are the subject of the ceremony.</p>
<p>The feast, though only to be solemnised in one village, is organised
and given by the whole community of villages. There is no (now) known
matter or event with reference to which it is held. It is decided upon
and arranged and prepared for long beforehand, say a year or two, and
feasts will only be held in one village at intervals of perhaps fifteen
or twenty years. The decision to hold a feast is arrived at by the
chiefs of the clans of the community which proposes to give it. The
village at which the feast is to be held will not necessarily be the
largest one of the community, or one in which is a then existing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4345" href="#xd26e4345" name=
"xd26e4345">126</a>]</span>chiefs <i>emone</i>. The guests to be
invited to it will be the people of some other (only one other)
community, and at the outset it will be ascertained more or less
informally whether or not they will be willing to accept the
invitation.</p>
<p>When the feast has been resolved upon, the preparations for it begin
immediately, that is a year or two before the date on which it is to be
held. Large quantities will be required of yam, taro and sugar-cane,
and of a special form of banana (not ripening on the trees, and
requiring to be cooked); also of the large fruit of the <i>ine</i>, a
giant species of Pandanus (see Plate <a href="#p080">80</a>&mdash;the
figure seated on the ground near to the base of the tree gives an idea
of the size of the latter and of the fruit head which is hanging from
it), which is cultivated in the bush, and the fruit heads of which are
oval or nearly round, and have a transverse diameter of about 18
inches; and of another fruit, called by the natives <i>malage</i>,
which grows wild, chiefly by streams, and is also cultivated, and the
fruit of which was described to me as being rather like an apple,
almost round, green in colour, and 4 or 5 inches in diameter.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4361src" href="#xd26e4361" name="xd26e4361src">1</a>
And above all things will be wanted an enormous number of village pigs
(not wild pigs); and sweet potatoes must be plentiful for the feeding
of these pigs. And finally they will need plenty of native tobacco for
their guests. In view of these requirements it is obvious that a year
or two is by no means an excessive period for the preparations for the
feast. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4367" href="#xd26e4367" name=
"xd26e4367">127</a>]</span></p>
<p>The existing yam and taro gardens, intended for community
consumption alone, will be quite insufficient for the purpose, and
fresh bush land is at once cleared, and new gardens are made and
planted, the products of these new gardens being allocated specially
for the feast, and not used for any other purpose. There is also an
extensive planting of sugar-cane, probably in old potato gardens. For
bananas there will probably be no great need of preparation, as they
are grown plentifully, and there is no specific appropriation of these;
but the sufficiency of the supply of the tobacco for the visitors, and
of the sweet potatoes for the pigs, has to be seen to, also that of the
<i>ine</i> Pandanus trees, the fruit of which has often to be procured
from elsewhere, and of the trees. And finally the village pigs must be
bred and fattened, for which latter purpose it is a common practice to
send young pigs to people in other communities; and these people will
be invited to the big feast, and will have pig given to them, though
not members of the invited community; but never in any case will any of
them have a part of a pig which he himself has fattened. The cultivated
vegetable foods and the pigs are not provided on a communistic basis,
but are supplied by the individual members of the community, each
household of which is expected to do its duty in this respect; and no
person who or whose family has not provided at least one pig (some of
them provide more than one) will be allowed to take part in the
preliminary feast and subsequent dancing, to be mentioned below.</p>
<p>The bringing in and storing of the <i>ine</i> and <i>malage</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4381" href="#xd26e4381" name=
"xd26e4381">128</a>]</span>fruits commence at an early stage. The
<i>ine</i> fruits are collected when quite ripe; they split the large
fruit heads up into two or more parts, put these into baskets roughly
made of cane (at least half a fruit head in each basket), and place
these baskets in the <i>avale</i> or ceiling of the <i>emone</i>, where
the fruits get dried and smoked by the heat and smoke of the fire
constantly burning beneath. If, as is sometimes the case, the
<i>emone</i> has no <i>avale</i> one is constructed specially for the
purpose. The fruits are left there until required; in fact, if taken
away from the smoke, they would go bad. Sometimes, instead of putting
portions of the fruit heads into baskets, they take out from them the
almond-shaped seeds, which are the portions to be eaten, string these
together, each seed being tied round and not pierced, and hang them to
the roof of the <i>emone</i> above the <i>avale</i>. The fruits of the
<i>malage</i> are gathered and put into holes or side streams by a
river, and there left for from seven to ten months, until the pulp,
which is very poisonous, is all rotted away, a terrible smell being
emitted during the process; they then take the pips or seeds, the
insides of which, after the surrounding shells have been cracked, are
the edible parts, and place these in baskets made out of the almost
amplexicaul bases of the leaves of a species of palm tree, and so store
them also on the <i>avale</i> of the <i>emone</i>.<a class="noteref"
id="n128.1src" href="#n128.1" name="n128.1src">2</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4426" href="#xd26e4426" name=
"xd26e4426">129</a>]</span></p>
<p>Large preparations of a structural and repairing nature are also
required in the village where the feast is to be held. The
<i>emone</i>, the true chiefs <i>emone</i>, of the village is repaired
or pulled down and entirely rebuilt; or, if that village does not
possess such an <i>emone</i>, one is erected in it. In point of fact
the usual practice is, I was informed, to build a new <i>emone</i>, the
occasion of an intended feast being the usually recognised time for the
doing of this.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4441src" href="#xd26e4441"
name="xd26e4441src">3</a> The houses of the village are put into
repair. The people of the other villages of the same community build
houses for themselves in the feast village, so that on the occasion of
the feast all the members of the community (the hosts) will be living
in that village. View platforms, from which the dancing can be watched,
are built by all the people of the community. These are built between
the houses where possible, or at all events so as to obstruct the view
from the houses as little as possible. They are built on upright poles,
and are generally between 12 and 20 feet high, each platform having a
roof, which will probably be somewhat similar to the roofs of the
houses. Sometimes there are two platforms under one roof, but this is
not usual. Sometimes the platforms, instead of being on <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4451" href="#xd26e4451" name=
"xd26e4451">130</a>]</span>posts, are in trees, being, however, roofed
like the others. Two or more houses may join in making one platform for
themselves and their friends. All the above works are put in hand at an
early stage.</p>
<p>The following are done later, perhaps not till after the sending out
of the formal invitation (see below), but they may conveniently be
dealt with here. The people erect near to, but outside, the village in
which the feast is to be held one or more sheds for the accommodation
of the guests, the number of sheds depending upon the requirements of
the case. These are merely gable and ridge-shaped roofs, which descend
on each side down to the ground, or very close to it, being supported
by posts, and there being no flooring. They are called <i>olor&rsquo;
eme</i>, which means dancers&rsquo; houses. Posts about 20 or 25 feet
high and 12 inches or nearly so in diameter are erected in various
places in the village enclosure, and each of these posts is surrounded
with three, four, or five upright bamboo stems, which are bound to the
post so as together to make a composite post of which the big one is
the strong supporting centre. The leaf branches of these bamboos,
starting out from the nodes of the stems, are cut off 3 or 4 inches
from their bases, thus leaving small pegs or hooks to which vegetables,
etc., can be afterwards hung; and in the case of each post one only of
its surrounding bamboos has the top branches and leaves left on. Each
household is responsible for the erection of one post. I may here say
in advance that upon these post clusters will be hung successively,
yams and taro in the upper <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4458"
href="#xd26e4458" name="xd26e4458">131</a>]</span>parts, human skulls
and bones lower down, and croton leaves by way of decoration at the
bottom. The sugar-cane and banana and <i>ine</i> and <i>malage</i> are
dealt with in another way. There is a further erection of thin poles,
which will be mentioned in its proper place.</p>
<p>About six months before the anticipated date of the big feast there
is a preliminary festivity, which is regarded as a sort of intimation
that the long-intended feast is shortly to take place. To this
festivity people of villages of any neighbouring communities, say
within an hour or two&rsquo;s walk, are invited. There is no dancing,
but there is a distribution among the guests of a portion of each of
the vegetables and fruits which will be consumed at the feast, and a
village pig is killed and cut up, and its parts are also distributed
among the guests, who then return home.</p>
<p>After this preliminary festivity dancing begins in the village in
which the feast is to be held and in the other villages of the same
community, and this dancing goes on, subject to weather, every day
until the evening prior to the day upon which the feast takes place.
The men dance in the villages, beginning at about sundown, and going on
through the evening, and perhaps throughout the night. Only men who or
whose families have provided at least one pig for the feast are allowed
to join in the dancing. Bachelors join in the dancing, subject to the
above condition. The women dance outside their villages, and, as
regards them, there is no pig qualification.</p>
<p>About a month before the date on which the feast is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4472" href="#xd26e4472" name=
"xd26e4472">132</a>]</span>proposed to be held, a formal invitation is
sent out to the community which is to be invited to it, and who, as
above stated, have already been approached informally in the matter.
For this purpose a number, perhaps ten, twenty, or thirty, of the men
of the community giving the feast start off, taking with them several
bunches of croton leaves&mdash;one bunch for each village of the
invited community. These men, if the invited community be some distance
off, only carry the croton leaves as far as some neighbouring
community, probably about one day&rsquo;s journey off, where they stay
the night, and then return. During their progress, and particularly as
they arrive at their destination, they are all singing. Then the men of
this neighbouring community carry the croton leaves a stage further;
and so on till they reach their ultimate destination. This may involve
two or three sets of messengers, but occasionally one or two of the
original messengers may go the whole way. These croton leaves are
delivered to the chiefs of the several clans of the invited community,
and they are tied to the front central posts of the village
<i>emone</i>, the true <i>emone</i> of the chiefs village, and, as
regards other villages, the <i>emone</i> of the sub-chiefs.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4483src" href="#xd26e4483" name=
"xd26e4483src">4</a></p>
<p>The exact date of the feast depends upon the guests, who may come in
a month after receiving the croton leaves, or may be later; and the
community giving the feast do not know on what date their guests will
arrive <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4498" href="#xd26e4498" name=
"xd26e4498">133</a>]</span>until news comes that they are actually on
their way, though in the meantime messengers will be passing backwards
and forwards and native wireless telegraphy (shouting from ridge to
ridge) will be employed.</p>
<p>As soon as the formal invitation has been sent the people of the
community giving the feast begin to bring in the yams from the gardens,
which they do day by day, singing as they do so; and these yams are
stored away in the houses as they are brought in. When the yams have
all been collected, they are brought out and spread in one, two, or
three long lines along the centre of the village open space. The owner
of each post knows which are his own yams, and they will go to his
post. When the yams are laid out on the ground, the chiefs inspect
them, and select the best ones, which are to be given to the chiefs of
the community invited to the dance. To these selected yams they tie
croton leaves as distinguishing marks. Then each man stands by his own
yams, and has a boy standing by his own post; each man picks up his
best yams, and whilst holding these they all (only the men with the
yams) begin to sing. The moment the song is over, each man rushes with
his selected best yam to his post, and hands the yam to the boy, who
climbs up the post, and hangs up the yam. After this they hang the rest
of the yams, each man running with them to the post, and giving them to
the boy, who climbs up and hangs the yam whilst the man runs back for
another, the performance being all in apparent disorder and there being
no singing. Some of the best-shaped <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4502" href="#xd26e4502" name="xd26e4502">134</a>]</span>yams are
hung to little cross-sticks about 3 or 4 feet long, which the boys then
and there attach to those bamboo stems which have their top branches
and leaves left upon them, the sticks being attached just below these
branches. These selected yams will include those with the croton
leaves, which are intended for chiefs. Of the rest the better yams are
hung up higher on the posts, and the poorer ones lower down. The lowest
of them will probably be 5 or 6 feet from the ground.</p>
<p>After hanging the yams, the next step is to erect in the ground all
round the village enclosure and in front of the houses a number of tall
young slender straight-stemmed tree poles, with the top branches and
leaves only left upon them. These poles are connected with one another
by long stems, fixed horizontally to them at a height of 7 or 8 feet
from the ground, the stems thus forming a sort of long line or girdle
encircling the village enclosure.</p>
<p>The men then go to their gardens and bring in the sugar-canes,
singing as they do so, and these they hang to the horizontal stems, but
without ceremony. The sugar-canes are all in thick bundles, perhaps 12
or 18 inches thick, and these bundles are hung horizontally end to end
immediately under the line of stems, so as also to make a continuous
encircling line.</p>
<p>Next they bring in the bananas, again singing, and these they hang
up on the tall, slender tree poles, and on the platforms of the houses,
and under the view platforms, but without ceremony. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4510" href="#xd26e4510" name=
"xd26e4510">135</a>]</span></p>
<p>Lastly, again singing, they bring in the taro, and hang these up,
mixed with the yams (not below them) on the posts, again without
ceremony. The hanging up of the taro is left to the last, and, in fact,
is not done till it is known that the guests are on their way, as the
taro would be spoilt by bad weather.</p>
<p>In hanging the yam and the taro the people all work
simultaneously&mdash;that is, they are all hanging yams at the same
time and all hanging taro at the same time. But as regards the sugar
cane and banana each man works in his own time without waiting for, or
being waited for by, the others. Women may help the men in all these
things, except the ceremonious hanging up of the yams.</p>
<p>They do not, however, hang all the yam, sugar-cane, banana and taro,
some of each being kept back in the houses for a purpose which will
appear hereafter.</p>
<p>The <i>ine</i> and <i>malage</i> fruits are not hung up at all, but
are kept in the <i>avale</i> of the village <i>emone</i> until the day
of the actual feast, when the various vegetables and fruits are, as
will be seen, put in heaps for distribution among the guests.</p>
<p>They then further decorate the posts with human skulls and bones,
which are hung round in circles below the yams and taro, but not
reaching to the ground. These are the skulls and bones of chiefs and
members of their families and sub-chiefs and important personages only
of the community, and the bones used are only the larger bones of the
arms and legs; skulls will, so far as possible, be used for the purpose
in preference to the other bones. These skulls and bones are taken
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4533" href="#xd26e4533" name=
"xd26e4533">136</a>]</span>from wherever they may then happen to be;
some of them will be in burial boxes on trees,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4535src" href="#xd26e4535" name="xd26e4535src">5</a> some may be
in graves underground, and some may be hung up in the village
<i>emone</i>; though it may here be mentioned that those underground
and in the <i>emone</i> are not, as I shall show later, in their
original places of sepulture.</p>
<p>Finally croton leaves, tied in sheaves, are arranged round the posts
below the skulls and bones, so as to decorate the posts down to the
ground.</p>
<p>One other specially important matter must here be mentioned. There
will probably be in or by the edge of the village enclosure a high
box-shaped wooden burial platform,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4552src"
href="#xd26e4552" name="xd26e4552src">6</a> supported on poles, and
containing the skull and all the bones of a chief, these platforms and
a special sort of tree being, as will be explained later on, the only
places where they and their families and important personages are
originally buried. If so, the people add to the bones on this platform
such of the other skulls and special arm and leg bones, collected as
above mentioned, as are not required for decorating the posts. If, as
is most improbable, there is no such burial platform, then they erect
one, and upon it place all the available skulls and special bones not
required for the posts.</p>
<p>These various preparations bring us to the evening before the day of
the feast, upon which evening the women, married and unmarried, of the
community, whose families have supplied pigs for the feast, dance
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4558" href="#xd26e4558" name=
"xd26e4558">137</a>]</span>together in full dancing decorations in the
village enclosure, beginning at about sundown, and, if weather permits,
dancing all through the night. There is no ceremony connected with this
dancing.</p>
<p>The next day is the feast day. The guests are in the special guest
houses outside the village, where they are dressing for the dance. They
have probably arrived the day before, in which case they may have come
into the village to watch the women dancing in the evening; but they
are not regarded as having formally arrived. These guests include
married and unmarried men, women and children, nobody of the invited
community being left behind, except old men and women who cannot walk.
The women have brought with them their carrying bags, in which they
carry all their men&rsquo;s and their own goods (<i>e.g.</i>, knives,
feathers, ornaments, etc.), including not only the things used for the
ceremony, but all their other portable property, which they do not wish
to expose to risk of theft by leaving at home.</p>
<p>They have also brought special ornamental bags to be used in the
dance as mentioned below.</p>
<p>The people of the village in the meantime erect one, two, or three
(generally three) trees in a group in the very centre of the village
enclosure.</p>
<p>And now come the successive ceremonies of the feast, in which both
married and unmarried men and women take part; in describing these
ceremonies I will call the people of the community giving the feast the
&ldquo;hosts,&rdquo; and the visitors attending it the
&ldquo;guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First: All or nearly all the men hosts go in a body <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4573" href="#xd26e4573" name=
"xd26e4573">138</a>]</span>out of the village to the guests&rsquo;
houses, singing as they go. They are all fully ornamented for a feast,
but do not wear their special dancing ornaments, and they do not carry
their spears, or as a rule any other weapons. Each chiefs ornaments
include a bunch of black cassowary feathers tied round his head behind,
and falling down over his shoulders, this being his distinctive
ornament; but otherwise his ornaments do not differ from those of the
rest, except probably as regards quantity and quality. The object of
this visit is to ascertain if the guests are ready, and if they are not
ready the men hosts wait until they are so. Then the men hosts return
to the village, singing as before, and all the guests, men and women,
follow them; but they do not sing, and they do not enter the village.
The men hosts, on returning, retire to their houses and the view
platforms, where also are the women hosts, thus leaving the village
enclosure empty.</p>
<p>Second: All the women guests, except two, then enter the village.
They are fully ornamented for the feast, but do not wear their special
dancing ornaments. They all have large carrying bags on their backs,
not the common ones of everyday use, but the ornamental ones; and in
these they carry and show off all their own and their husbands&rsquo;
riches other than what they respectively are actually wearing. They
enter at one end of the village enclosure (I will hereafter call this
the &ldquo;entrance end&rdquo;) by the side of the end <i>emone</i> of
the village (this may be the chiefs true <i>emone</i> or it may be the
secondary <i>emone</i>), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4586" href=
"#xd26e4586" name="xd26e4586">139</a>]</span>and walk in single file
along one side of the village enclosure, and half of them walk round
the other end (which I will call the &ldquo;far end&rdquo;) in front of
the <i>emone</i> there (which also will be either the true one or the
other one), and back again along the other side, until there are two
rows of them, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> at opposite sides of the
enclosure, none of them remaining at the far end in front of the
<i>emone</i> there. If they are very numerous, there may be lines on
both sides of the enclosure, stretching from end to end; whereas if
they are few only, they would be in facing lines at the far end only of
the enclosure. This is all done silently.</p>
<p>Third: All the women hosts, fully ornamented for a feast, but
without special dancing ornaments, then enter the enclosure at the
entrance end, and congregate at the far end of it, in front of the far
<i>emone</i> and between the two facing lines of women guests, and
facing towards the centre of the enclosure. The group of them stretches
as far forward towards the centre of the enclosure as their number
allows; but it will never extend beyond the special trees, which have
been last erected in the centre. This also is done in silence.</p>
<p>Fourth: The two women guests excluded from the general entry now
come in. They are presumably the wives of chiefs. They are also
decorated for the feast, but without full dancing ornaments. Each of
them, however, holds in her mouth something intended to give her a
terrible appearance, probably two pairs of pigs&rsquo; tusks, one pair
curling, crescent-like, upwards, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4605" href="#xd26e4605" name="xd26e4605">140</a>]</span>and the
other pair similarly curling downwards, or a piece of cloth; but this
is only carried by her for this particular scene of the performance,
and not afterwards. Each of them also carries two spears, one in each
hand. These two women rush into the village enclosure, one entering at
each side of the <i>emone</i> at the entrance end. They run along the
two sides of the enclosure, one at each side, in front of the lines of
women guests already there (between them and the central group of host
women), brandishing their spears as they do so, but in silence. When
they reach the far end of the enclosure they meet each other in front
of the <i>emone</i> there; and then, if that happens to be the true
(chief&rsquo;s) <i>emone</i>, they brandish their spears in a hostile
manner at the building, the spears sometimes even striking it, though
they do not leave the women&rsquo;s hands, and there is probably a
little pause or halt in their running for the purpose of this attack.
They then pass each other, and return as they had come, still
brandishing their spears, but each on the opposite side, until they are
both at the entrance end of the enclosure. If the <i>emone</i> at this
end is the true <i>emone</i>, then the attack is made upon it, instead
of upon the other one. They then generally again pass each other, and
go round the enclosure a second time, and again attack the <i>emone</i>
exactly as before. During the first part of this performance the host
women congregated in the far end of the enclosure are all dancing a
sort of non-progressive goose step, there being, however, no singing.
But, when the two guest women on the return journey <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4626" href="#xd26e4626" name=
"xd26e4626">141</a>]</span>of their second circuit reach the front row
of the host women, the latter advance in a body silently dancing (but
not travelling so fast as the two guest women) down the enclosure, and
so following the two guest women, until they are all congregated at the
entrance end of the enclosure. The positions of the <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> up to and including the stage of proceedings lastly
described will be better understood by reference to <a href=
"#fig07">Fig. 7</a> and its accompanying notes. At <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4634" href="#xd26e4634" name=
"xd26e4634">142</a>]</span>the end of this stage the lines of guest
women are still as shown; but the two special guest women and all the
host women are at the entrance end of the enclosure.</p>

<p><abbr title="Nota Bene">N.B.</abbr>&mdash;The decorated posts are
scattered about the village enclosure.</p>
<p>Fifth: Such of the guest men as are not going to join in the real
ultimate dance (see heading 9) enter the village at the entrance end,
they also being fully ornamented, but not wearing their special dancing
ornaments. They carry their spears, and perhaps in their other hands
their clubs or adzes. Any chiefs who may be among them wear their black
cassowary feather ornaments, like those of the host chiefs. They all
advance along the enclosure, jumping and dancing and brandishing their
spears, but not singing; and in front of them go all the host women,
dancing as before, also in silence. This double body of people, host
women in front, and guest men behind, advance <i>en masse</i> along the
village enclosure. When, in doing this, the guest men reach the three
last-erected special trees in the middle of the enclosure, they attack
the trees with their spears, never letting the spears leave their
hands, and with kicks, and thus try to knock the trees down. If they
succeed in doing so, then this part of the performance is at an end,
and these guest men disperse and spread about at both sides and ends of
the village; but the host and guest women return from wherever they are
to the entrance end. If the guest men&rsquo;s first attack on the trees
is not successful, they pass them, and continue their advance, as
before, to the far end of the enclosure and return back again in the
other direction, the host women still dancing in front of them; and on
this return journey <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4696" href=
"#xd26e4696" name="xd26e4696">143</a>]</span>they repeat their attack
on the trees. If again unsuccessful, they go on to their starting
point, and go a second time through the same performance as before,
going up the enclosure, and, if necessary, down again; and, if still
unsuccessful, they will probably try a third time, the host women
always dancing in front of them as before. The whole of this is one
continuous movement, going on till the trees are down. If after the
third double attempt the guest men have still been unsuccessful, they
relinquish their efforts; and in that case the pig-killer of the
hosts&rsquo; village (as to whom see below) steps forward, and cuts
down the trees with his adze. When the trees are down, the performance
is at an end, the guest men retire, and the host and guest women return
to the entrance end, as above stated.</p>
<p>Sixth: Such of the chiefs of the guests as do not intend to join in
the real ultimate dance (heading 9) then step forward into the
enclosure at the entrance end. Their number may be two or three or
more. They wear their full dancing ornaments, including their black
cassowary feather ornaments and the enormous feather erections on their
heads, which for chiefs are even larger and heavier than for other
people. They carry their drums, but not spears or clubs or adzes. The
two special guest women who have already been mentioned and two other
guest women, all with their full dancing ornaments, also come forward.
A line is formed with the chiefs in the middle and the four women at
the two ends. In front of this line are all the host women, still
decorated as before, but without special dancing ornaments. Then the
whole group, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4700" href="#xd26e4700"
name="xd26e4700">144</a>]</span>host women in front and the guest
chiefs and their four attendant guest women in a line behind, dance
forward along the enclosure. In doing this, they face the direction in
which they are progressing, and their progress is slow. This is done to
the accompaniment of the beating by the dancing chiefs of their drums,
but there is no singing. When the dancing party reach the far end of
the enclosure, they go back again in the same way; and so on again
until the chiefs (with the great weights they are carrying) are tired;
then they stop. But the men hosts thereupon politely press them to go
on again, giving them in fact a sort of complimentary encore, and this
they will probably do. After about half-an-hour from the commencement
of the dancing they finally stop. Then the chief of the clan in one of
whose villages the dance is held comes forward and removes the heavy
head-pieces from the dancing chiefs.</p>
<p>Seventh: An important ceremony now occurs. The chief of the clan
cuts away the supports of the burial platform already mentioned,
whereupon the platform falls to the ground, and the skulls and bones
upon it roll on the ground. These are picked up, and the skulls and big
arm and leg bones are put on one side. There is no singing or ceremony
in connection with this. The platform is not rebuilt; and what is
afterwards done with the skulls and bones will be seen hereafter.</p>
<p>Eighth: There is now a distribution among the chiefs and more
important male guests of the yam, taro, sugar-cane and bananas, which
at the time of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4707" href=
"#xd26e4707" name="xd26e4707">145</a>]</span>hanging up on the village
posts were kept back and put into the houses, and of tobacco. The chief
of the clan, with help from others, makes a number of heaps of these
things in the centre of the village enclosure, the number of heaps
corresponding to the number of recipients. Then, standing successively
before each of these heaps, he calls out in turn the names of the men
who are to receive them, chiefs being given the first priority, and
specially important people the next. Each man comes forward, usually
bringing with him his wife or some other woman with a bag, picks up his
heap, and takes it away. And so with all of them in turn, till all is
finished. On each heap there is usually, but not always, a portion of a
village pig, which has that morning been killed under the burial
platform, before it was cut down. The guests, men and women, then
return to the guest houses, where the women cook the food which has
been given, and it is eaten by the men and themselves.</p>
<p>Ninth: The real dance now takes place, beginning perhaps at 9 or 10
in the evening, and lasting the whole night, and perhaps till 10
o&rsquo;clock the following morning. The dancing is done by some only
of the guest men, and none of their women, and none of the hosts,
either men or women, join in it. The dancers are all arrayed in full
dancing ornaments, including their heavy head feather erections, and
chiefs also wear their cassowary feathers; and they all carry their
drums and spears, and sometimes clubs or adzes. After the dance has
begun, the chief of the clan in whose village the dance occurs
distributes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4711" href="#xd26e4711"
name="xd26e4711">146</a>]</span>with assistance, among the more
important of these dancers, especially chiefs, the skulls and bones
which had been put on one side after the cutting down of the burial
platform, and probably some or all of the skulls and bones which had
been hung upon the big posts; and the dancers receiving these skulls
and bones wear them as additional decoration upon their arms throughout
the dance. Guest chiefs dance with the others, but owing to the heavy
weight of the head ornaments they have to carry, they will be tired
sooner than the others. The dancing party enter the village at the
entrance end, walking backwards. Directly after they have entered the
village they, still having their backs to it, begin to beat their
drums, after doing which for a short time they turn round, and the
dancing begins. The dancers beat their drums whilst dancing, but
neither they nor the other people sing during the actual dancing. There
are, however, intervals in the dancing (not the mere rest intervals,
such as they have in Mekeo, and which they also have in Mafulu, but
intervals which are themselves an actual part of the dance), and during
these intervals the drums are not being beaten, and the dancers and the
other people, hosts, guests, men and women, all sing. I shall have
something more to say about dancing generally later on. At a subsequent
stage the skulls and bones with which the dancers have been decorated,
including those which had fallen from the burial platform, are all
again hung up among the other skulls and bones on the big posts.</p>
<p>Tenth: This is the stage at which occur various <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4715" href="#xd26e4715" name=
"xd26e4715">147</a>]</span>other ceremonies, which, though themselves
quite distinct from that of the big feast, and performed, often several
of them together, when there is no big feast, are also, some or all of
them, generally or always introduced into it, as being a convenient
occasion for them. The ceremonies in question are those connected with
the assumption of the perineal band, admission to the <i>emone</i> and
the giving of the right to carry a drum and dance, that of
nose-piercing, and that on the devolution of chieftainship. The
nose-piercing ceremony has already been described. The others will be
dealt with later.</p>
<p>Eleventh: Next comes the general distribution among the guests of
the vegetables and fruits, including all those which have been hung up
and displayed, as above described, and the <i>ine</i> fruit, prepared
in two ways, and <i>malage</i> fruit. Every male guest who has joined
in the real dance is, speaking generally, entitled to have a share;
though sometimes, where there are two or three members of one family,
shares may be given to one or two of them only, instead of to each. The
chiefs of the community giving the feast work together in carrying out
the distribution. The various things are collected into a number of
heaps about the village, the number of heaps corresponding to the
number of portions to be distributed; and each heap contains something
of everything. Excluded from these heaps, however, are the <i>ine</i>
seeds which have been put on strings and preserved separately, as
before explained. For these are erected stakes about 10 feet high,
round which the strings of seeds <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e4731" href="#xd26e4731" name="xd26e4731">148</a>]</span>are
twined. The number of these stakes is less than the number of heaps,
because they are only planted near to the heaps which contain none of
the <i>ine</i> fruit prepared the other way, so that each dancing guest
gets some of this fruit, done in either one way or the other. Then the
chiefs of the hosts&rsquo; community stand round one of the heaps and
shout wildly, calling upon the recipient. This may be done by name, or
it may in the case of a chief be done by the name of a spot, say a
mound or hollow, adjoining the village from which he comes. Here,
again, priority is given first to chiefs, and next to important
personages. The man so called upon comes running forward with his wife
or another woman, picks up his vegetables and fruit, and runs back
again with them. Then the chiefs go on to another heap, and again
afterwards to the others, one by one, going through the same process in
each case, until everything has been distributed. Some of the women
then go back to their own villages, carrying with them a portion of the
food which has been given to their husbands, but leaving the rest with
the latter. Sometimes some of the guest men go home also. But anyone
who is proposing to return to the village of the feast must leave some
of his food, or bring food on his return, as no more will be given to
him.</p>
<p>Twelfth: The next stage is the collection of the village pigs. This
may take some time, as many of them are running about in the bush, and
have to be caught; and some of them have been agisted out as above
mentioned, and have to be fetched. This may involve a delay of a week
or ten days, during which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4741"
href="#xd26e4741" name="xd26e4741">149</a>]</span>most or all of the
guests remain, sleeping in their guest houses at night, and perhaps
roaming about among other villages in the neighbourhood by day. During
this interval there is neither singing nor dancing.</p>
<p>Thirteenth: The village pigs are all brought in alive, and placed
under the houses of the village, each pig having its legs tied up and
being tied to the house. When all is ready, the chief of the clan
announces that the killing of the pigs will take place on the following
morning.</p>
<p>Fourteenth: The next morning all the people, both hosts and guests,
are in the village to watch the pig-killing; and people from other
communities, who are not guests, and will not receive any pig, come
too. The pigs are brought out one by one, and killed by hitting them on
the head with clubs or adzes or anything else. This is not a chiefs
duty. There is a man who is the recognised pig-killer, and who, as
already stated, will probably be a man of some position, though not
either a chief or a sub-chief. Where there are many pigs, as at the big
feast, there will be a number of other men helping him. Each pig is
killed on the site of the burial platform which has been cut down. As
the pigs are killed, their bodies are carried away and placed on the
ground in a row, commencing at the end of the village enclosure, and
forming a central line along it; and it is usual also to place upon the
row of dead pigs a continuous line of long thin poles, laid end to end,
which are afterwards kept tied to the <i>emone</i> as a record of the
total length of the line of pigs, and thus <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4750" href="#xd26e4750" name=
"xd26e4750">150</a>]</span>of the number of pigs killed. The number of
pigs killed is generally very large in proportion to the size of the
community giving the feast, much more so than is the case in the
villages of Mekeo and the coast. It may be anything from fifty to over
one hundred; in fact at a recent feast given by a community of seven
villages, having between them about a hundred houses, they killed 135
pigs. Some chiefs of the hosts&rsquo; community then take some of the
bones (not skulls) from the big posts, and dip them into the mouths of
the pigs, from which the blood is flowing. They have been seen to dip
one bone into several pigs. There does not appear to be any method of
selection of the bones to be dipped. They then touch with the bones
which have been so dipped the skulls and all the other bones on the
posts, which include the skulls and other special bones of all the
chiefs and members of their families and other prominent people buried
in and by the villages of the community since the last previous big
feast was held there. After this all the bones are again hung up on the
posts. I may say here in advance that, when the feast is over, all the
bones are removed from the posts; and, the ceremony as regards those
bones having been performed, they will never again be the subject of
ceremonial observance. They, or some of them, may be hung up in the
<i>emone</i>, but if so it is known that they are not to be used again
for ceremonial purposes; or they may be put in a box in a tree, or hung
up on a tree, not necessarily of the special species used for burying;
or they may be simply flung away anywhere in the bush. Whilst the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4755" href="#xd26e4755" name=
"xd26e4755">151</a>]</span>bodies of the slain pigs lie in a line, and
before the cutting up, it is the duty of each man who has had a pig fed
up for him to pay the man who has done so, the payment probably being a
string of dogs&rsquo; teeth, or head feather ornaments. Next, the hosts
set to work to cut up the pigs. This is not done by a chief or special
person, nor is there any ceremony connected with it. Each pig is cut
into seven parts, namely, (1) the head, (2&ndash;5) the four legs, (6)
the bowels and internal parts, and (7) the back and sides. I was told
that each part of each pig is destined for a certain person, as
arranged beforehand. It follows that, if there are, say, 100 pigs,
there are 700 predestined pieces, which are known and remembered,
though there are no means of recording them. It is difficult to believe
the truth of this, but I was assured that it was correct. The pieces of
each pig are placed on banana leaves, by the side of the spot where the
body had lain, and all the pieces are distributed among the male
guests. Everybody who has given a pig knows the length of each part of
it, though he could not express it in numerals. Each male guest has a
piece given to him, which, if the feast be a return feast, will
correspond in some way, which I could not understand, with what he had
himself provided at the previous feast. But dancers receive larger and
better portions than do mere singers. People who have fed up pigs for
members of the hosts&rsquo; community also receive portions. In the
distribution of pig each man is called in turn as before, and in the
same order of priority, and runs up and gets his piece of pig, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4757" href="#xd26e4757" name=
"xd26e4757">152</a>]</span>runs back with it; but in this case he is
not accompanied by a woman.</p>
<p>Fifteenth: The feast is now over, and all the guests return to their
homes, taking away with them everything that has been given to
them.</p>
<p>Sixteenth: The village has, however, to undergo a process which I
may perhaps call purification. As soon as possible after the guests
have gone, the men of the community go off into the bush and capture
wild pigs, for which purpose they may have to hunt for three or four
days, or even for a week or more. They must have at least one pig, and
they generally have two or more, even up to six. When caught, the pigs
are brought alive into the village, and are killed upon the site of the
cut-down burial platform, this being done by the pig-killer. The pigs
are then cut up and eaten by the members of the villages of the
community, those of the village itself eating their portions there, and
those of the other villages taking their portions away and eating them
in their own villages. Except as regards the killing of the pigs on the
site of the grave, the whole performance appears to be quite informal.
After the eating of the pigs, perhaps on the same day, or if, as is
probable, the feast lasts until late in the evening, then on the next
day, the women of the village clear away the filthy mess of blood and
garbage by which the village enclosure is filled, and sweep the
enclosure from end to end with branches of trees. Then the bulk of the
villagers leave the village and go off into the gardens and the bush
for a period of about six months. The feast has <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4763" href="#xd26e4763" name=
"xd26e4763">153</a>]</span>denuded the village of food, including even
sweet potatoes, to which they have had no time to attend during the
period before the feast, and which have been used up in the feeding of
the village pigs required for it. New gardens are needed, and therefore
new bush has to be cut down, and the land must be cleared and planted
with various things, and especially with sweet potato. For this purpose
it is requisite or usual for them to build temporary houses on the
scene of their labours, in which the people live. The old people,
however, remain in the village, as do also some of the younger ones,
who have to tend the gardens close to it. At the end of the period they
all return, and village life goes on as usual. What the idea in the
native mind may be concerning what I have called the purification of
the village is a matter upon which I was unable to find any clue,
beyond what may be suspected from the actual facts of the proceeding;
but I think it probably has a superstitious origin. Although in theory
all the village pigs have been killed and given to the guests at the
big feast, there are always some left wandering in the bush, which have
not been caught. These pigs are, however, never used in the
purification ceremony, in which they always kill wild pigs only. It has
been suggested to me that a reason for this may be that, if they killed
village pigs, they would thereby advertise the fact that they had not
killed and distributed all their village pigs at the big feast; but
this hardly seems to be a satisfactory explanation. It clearly falls to
the ground as regards present intent if, as I was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4765" href="#xd26e4765" name=
"xd26e4765">154</a>]</span>told, there always is an unkilled residue of
village pigs after a big feast. The practice of killing wild pigs only
would seem to associate itself with the fact that pigs killed at this
ceremony are eaten in the village itself, for there seems to be no
doubt that among the Mafulu people village pigs are never eaten in
their own village on ceremonial occasions; and indeed it seems doubtful
whether they are ever eaten there at all.</p>
<p>In fact, it appears to be a general custom in connection with all
ceremonial feasts to which outside guests are invited, to kill village
pigs only at the feast, and for these to be given to the guests to be
eaten by them in their own villages, and afterwards to have a second
feast, to which outside guests are not invited, and at which wild pigs
are killed, and eaten by the villagers themselves within the
village.</p>
<p>The pig-killing is generally, and perhaps always, done in the
morning.</p>
<p>It is thought by the Mafulu Fathers of the Mission as regards the
subsequent partial desertion of the village that, although it is only
partial, and although there is a practical reason for it, it is based
upon superstition, and is regarded by the people as being a formal
leaving of the village, pending its complete purification.</p>
<p>Plates <a href="#p067">67</a> to <a href="#p070">70</a> are
reproductions of four photographs which Father Clauser was good enough
to give me, the two former ones having been taken at the big feast held
in the village of Amalala in the year 1909 and the two latter prior to
and at a big feast held in the village of Seluku. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4782" href="#xd26e4782" name=
"xd26e4782">155</a>]</span></p>
<p>I have thought it better to avoid the insertion of frequent, and
perhaps somewhat confusing, references to these plates in the body of
my notes upon the feast, and to take the plates separately, drawing
attention to what appear to be points of interest in them.</p>
<p><a href="#p067">Plate 67</a> represents the scene at Amalala
immediately prior to or during the general distribution of vegetables
and fruits (<i>ante</i> heading 11). A comparison of this scene with
the village in its normal condition, as shown in Plates <a href=
"#p056">56</a> and <a href="#p057">57</a>, gives some idea of the very
extensive and elaborate preparations which are made for the feast. On
the right hand side are seen some view platforms, and beyond them on
the same side is a normal house. Here and there are the big posts
surrounded with bamboo stems (notice these posts denuded of their
bamboo appendages still remaining in the village enclosure as shown in
Plates <a href="#p056">56</a> and <a href="#p057">57</a>). Some of the
vegetables are seen still hanging upon these post clusters, and near
the base of two of them are seen the sheaves of croton leaves. There
are apparently no skulls and bones upon the posts seen in the plate,
but possibly the re-hanging of these had not been attended to when the
photo was taken, or perhaps they had been suspended to other posts not
shown in the photograph. Upon the ground are the heaps of vegetables,
and close to some of these are the stakes round which are twined
strings of seeds of the <i>ine</i> Pandanus.</p>
<p><a href="#p068">Plate 68</a> is a photograph taken after the
subsequent pig-killing, and shows the pigs&rsquo; bodies lying in a row
along the centre of the village enclosure, with the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4812" href="#xd26e4812" name=
"xd26e4812">156</a>]</span>measuring line of poles placed above them.
It will be noticed that the elaborate view platforms have been cleared
away, but that the bamboo stems have not yet been removed from their
central posts.</p>
<p><a href="#p069">Plate 69</a> represents a scene at Seluku prior to a
big feast then about to be held. The view platforms have not yet been
erected. But the post clusters have been erected, and the yams and
croton leaves have been hung upon them. In the centre of the village
enclosure is the chief&rsquo;s grave platform, which will be cut down
during the festivities in the way above described.</p>
<p>The bones of the chief are in the box-like receptacle at the top of
the structure, and the receptacle rather further down (underneath the
other one) contains the bones of a chief&rsquo;s child.</p>
<p><a href="#p070">Plate 70</a> shows five men at the Seluku feast with
full dancing ornaments, including the great feather head ornaments. One
of them has donned a piece of European calico, and the one to the
extreme right appears to have done the same. These would doubtless be
regarded as highly decorative additions. A few long thin dancing
ribbons can be seen hanging from their belts. The elaborate carved
(turtle?) shell ornament hanging over the breast of the man to the left
is certainly not of Mafulu make, and has probably come from the coast.
I never saw anything like it when I was at Mafulu. The two boys in
front are holding the ornament of elaborately prepared strings of
feathers hung upon a stick, and worn by dancers on their backs, and
into which the best feathers are generally put. <span class=

<h3 class="main">Ceremony on Birth.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is no ceremony on the birth of a child, except
in the case of the first-born of a chief. On this occasion the women of
a neighbouring community are invited. They come in their full dancing
ornaments, and armed in both hands with spears and either clubs or
adzes. They rush into the village, first to the chiefs house and then
to his <i>emone</i>; and at each of these they make a warlike
demonstration, actually hurling their spears at the buildings with such
force that the spears sometimes go through the thatch of the roof. Then
follows a distribution of vegetables among the visitors, after which
one, two, or three village pigs are killed under a chiefs burial
platform or on the site of a past one, cut up in the ordinary way, as
at the big feast, given to the visitors and taken away by them, and the
ceremony is over. There is no singing.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Ceremony on Assumption of Perineal Band.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This ceremony is performed for both boys and girls,
and usually for several at one time.</p>
<p>The children are heavily adorned with ornaments, consisting, as a
rule, chiefly of dogs&rsquo; teeth, which are hung round their necks,
or over their foreheads; and they usually have belts of dogs&rsquo;
teeth round their waists. Any persons may decorate the children.</p>
<p>Prior to the ceremony a number of box-like receptacles are erected
in the village by the children&rsquo;s relatives, there being one
receptacle for each child for whom the ceremony is to be performed.
These receptacles are made with upright corner poles 8 or 10 feet high,
boxed in with cross-pieces of wood up to a height of 5 or 6 feet. In
these receptacles are put yams and taro, upon their upright poles are
hung bananas and upon their cross-pieces of wood are hung lengths of
sugar-cane; all this being done by the families of the children.</p>
<p>Guests are invited from some other community or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4856" href="#xd26e4856" name=
"xd26e4856">159</a>]</span>communities. There is a dance, in which only
people from outside communities take part. A village pig must be
provided by the family of each child. Each of these pigs is killed by
the pig-killer under a chiefs platform grave, or, if no such platform
then exists, upon the site of one, and is cut up. Before the
cutting-up, however, the child in each case stands upon the body of the
pig, and whilst he so stands he is dressed with a feather ornament put
over his head, but which, instead of being tied up in the usual way at
the back of the head, is left with the ends hanging down over his
shoulders. The putting on of this ornament is not a chiefs duty, but is
done for each child by a certain person who has bought the pig from
that child&rsquo;s family.</p>
<p><a href="#p071">Plate 71</a> shows a little girl upon whom the
perineal band ceremony has just been performed. She has a string of
dogs&rsquo; teeth over her forehead, and a belt of dogs&rsquo; teeth
round her waist, an enormous crescent-shell ornament, some long
pigtails, and on her head is the feather ornament, which hangs down at
the sides over her shoulders. <a href="#p072">Plate 72</a> is a scene
taken at the feast held in connection with the performance of the
ceremony upon her and some other children.</p>
<p>I could not find out who the person who buys the pig and performs
the ceremony would ordinarily be, nor what motive he has for buying and
paying for a pig which is about to be killed and cut up and distributed
amongst other people; and I am convinced that there must be something
further behind the matter, which I have been unable to ascertain. I may
say <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4867" href="#xd26e4867" name=
"xd26e4867">160</a>]</span>that, knowing that among the Roro and Mekeo
people a brother or other male relative of the child&rsquo;s mother
takes a prominent part in the perineal band ceremony, being the
recipient of the dog or pig which is killed, and the person who puts
the band upon the boy, I specially enquired as to any similar
relationship on the part of the person who buys the pig and performs
the ceremony among the Mafulu, but I could find no trace of anything of
the sort.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4869src" href="#xd26e4869" name=
"xd26e4869src">2</a> Nor, as already stated, could I find any system of
service being rendered by a boy to his maternal uncle, such as exists

name="xd26e4878src">3</a> nor anything in the nature of the Koita
<i lang="xx">Heni</i> ceremony, described by Dr. Seligmann.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4887src" href="#xd26e4887" name=
"xd26e4887src">4</a></p>
<p>It will be seen that this purchasing of the pig by a person who
takes a prominent part in the ceremony affecting an individual appears
in other ceremonies of that nature among the Mafulu.</p>
<p>Following this performance there is a general distribution among the
people, including both visitors and members of the village, of the
various vegetables and fruits, and among the visitors only of the
portions of village pig. The vegetables are eaten then and there, but
the visitors take away the pig for eating in their own villages. The
actual putting on by the child <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4897"
href="#xd26e4897" name="xd26e4897">161</a>]</span>of his perineal band
is done afterwards without further ceremony.</p>
<p>The same ceremony is observed in the case of the son or daughter of
a chief, except that in this case the child is more fully decorated,
the family give two or more pigs, there are more visitors, and the
whole ceremony is on a larger scale; also that, after the performance
of standing on the dead pig and receiving the feather ornament, the
child is placed standing on a platform, which may be only 5 or 6 feet
high, but may be as much as 15 feet, though no further ceremony appears
to be performed whilst it is on that platform. If children of ordinary
people undergo the ceremony at the same time as a chief&rsquo;s child,
they apparently stand on the platform also.</p>
<p>When the ceremony is performed at a big feast, it is substantially
the same as that above described, subject to certain variations, which
almost naturally arise from the change of conditions. There is no
special dancing, as distinguished from the dancing programme of the big
feast. The vegetable food provided will be included in the general
stock, so that the people of the village will not share in it; and the
ceremony of standing on the pig is postponed till a later day, and on
that day, the child, having worn his special ornaments, other than the
feather ornament, at the big feast, will not again wear them when he
stands on the pig, though his feather ornament is put upon him on that
later day.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that this perineal band ceremony and all the
other ceremonies relating personally to both <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4906" href="#xd26e4906" name=
"xd26e4906">162</a>]</span>children and adults, if not performed at a
big feast, may be performed together, the people concerned in each
ceremony being taken more or less in batches; and indeed this generally
is so. But in that case each class of ceremony would be performed
separately. One person may have more than one ceremony performed for
him on the same occasion, but if so a separate pig must be provided in
respect of each of these ceremonies, and there must be a separate
receptacle and a separate supply of food in respect of each of them,
though it does not follow that the total amount of food to be provided,
other than pig, is proportionately increased.</p>
<p>At a subsequent date there will be a purification ceremony, at which
a wild pig or pigs will be killed and eaten by the villagers; though,
if the perineal band ceremony has taken place during a big feast, the
purification ceremony in connection with the latter will be the only
one to take place.</p>
<p>There is no system of seclusion of either boys or girls on attaining
puberty, or in connection with initiation, or on attaining a
marriageable age. Nor is there any initiation ceremony, or wearing of
ceremonial masks, or use of bull-roarers. The custom by which
chiefs&rsquo; children, when assuming the perineal band, are made to
stand on a platform reminds one, however, of the Hood Peninsular custom
for girls to stand on a dubu platform for the initiation ceremony, as
referred to by Dr. Seligmann.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4912src" href=

<h3 class="main">Ceremony on Admission to Emone.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Both boys and girls must undergo a ceremony before
being allowed to enter the <i>emone</i>. It generally takes place when
they are two, three, or four years old. The preliminary decoration of
the child is similar to that adopted for the perineal band ceremony,
except that, if the child has lost either of its parents, this
decoration is omitted. The erection of receptacles and provision of
food and pigs, and the invitation of guests and dancing, and the
killing of the pigs are the same as in the case of the other ceremony;
also each child has to stand on the pig which his people provide for
him.</p>
<p>There is, however, no putting on of a feather ornament, but instead
of it the following performance takes place:&mdash;Each child has been
carried by its mother or father or other relative, but is taken from
that person by the man who has bought the pig. This man places the
child on the dead pig; then he immediately picks the child up again,
and runs with it to one of the <i>emone</i>, upon the platform of which
two rows of men are sitting, and hands it to the man at the end of one
of the rows. The child is then rapidly passed from hand to hand along
that row, and then along the other row, after which it is returned to
its carrier, who runs with it to the other <i>emone</i>, on which also
two rows of men are sitting, and where a similar performance takes
place. During all this performance there is much shouting and calling
out to the child-carrier to hurry. Finally, when the child is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4934" href="#xd26e4934" name=
"xd26e4934">164</a>]</span>again handed back to this man, he returns it
to its parents, and the ceremony is finished.</p>
<p>The ceremony in the case of a chief&rsquo;s child seems to be the
same as that for other children, the platform business of the perineal
band ceremony being apparently omitted in this case.</p>
<p>If the ceremony is performed at a big feast, the variations are
substantially similar to those of the perineal band ceremony; and in
particular the placing of the child on the pig, and the running with it
to the <i>emone</i>, are postponed to a later date.</p>
<p>The observations as to the subsequent purification in connection
with the perineal band ceremony apply to this ceremony also.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that girls are included in this admission to the
<i>emone</i>. When a girl has undergone the admission ceremony she has
free entry into the <i>emone</i>&mdash;except that she must not sleep
there&mdash;until she formally receives her perineal band, upon which
her permission to enter the <i>emone</i> ceases.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ceremony Conferring Right to Use Drum and Dance.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This ceremony also applies to both boys and girls; but
I omitted to ascertain the age at which it usually occurs. It is
similar to the perineal band ceremony, except that the child is dressed
in dance ornaments (though not the fullest formal dance ornaments),
until we reach the stage of standing on the pig, and putting on of the
feather ornament, which is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4961"
href="#xd26e4961" name="xd26e4961">165</a>]</span>omitted; and, instead
of it, the person who has bought the pig places the child upon it, and
then for a short time beats a drum, after which he gives the drum to
the child, who also beats it, and then returns it to him.</p>
<p>I cannot say whether in this case there is any variation of the
ceremony as regards a chief&rsquo;s child; but I do not think there
is.</p>
<p>Here again I believe that, when the ceremony takes place at a big
feast, the variations are similar to those above described, and in
particular the standing on the pig and drum-beating are postponed.</p>

with the perineal band ceremony apply to this one also.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ceremony on Devolution of Chieftainship</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">When chieftainship devolves on the death of a chief to
his successor, there is no ceremony connected with the
devolution.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4974src" href="#xd26e4974" name=

<p>When a chief resigns in his lifetime, however, there is a ceremony.
There does not appear to be a special dance and feast connected with
this, it being always tacked on to some other ceremony or group of
ceremonies. This particular ceremony does not, in fact, begin until
after the pig-killing. The retiring chief will have provided one or
more pigs for the purpose of his ceremony, and these will have been
killed with the others. He addresses the people and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4979" href="#xd26e4979" name=
"xd26e4979">166</a>]</span>tells them that he is giving up his office
and transferring it to his successor; but in doing so he says nothing
about that successor&rsquo;s title to succeed, that being always known
and recognised. He then sits on his pig, and hands to his successor a
bamboo knife, such as is used for the cutting up of pigs. The
successor, having received the knife, takes the place of the retiring
chief on the pig, and tells the people that he accepts the office of
chief; after which he goes round to all the pigs which are there in
connection with all the various ceremonies to be gone through, one
after another, and in each case makes with the knife just given to him
a small slit at the end of the mouth of each pig.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4981src" href="#xd26e4981" name="xd26e4981src">7</a> This act is
regarded as a performance by the new chief of a chiefs office; and, as
under present customs the killing of the pig is commonly done by the
pig-killer, and the cutting of it up is done by anybody, one is tempted
to wonder whether the ceremony points to some chief&rsquo;s duty of the
past, which has ceased to exist, or to some unknown origin of the
status of the pig-killer.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ceremony on Building of a New Emone.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The usual occasion for the building of a new
<i>emone</i> is an impending big feast, the then existing <i>emone</i>
in the village being out of repair, or there being then no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4995" href="#xd26e4995" name=
"xd26e4995">167</a>]</span>true <i>emone</i> in the village. But
<i>emone</i> are built at other times also.</p>
<p>The actual building of the <i>emone</i> is carried out by the whole
clan without ceremony; but when it is finished they erect tall slender
straight-stemmed tree poles, passing through the roof of the
<i>emone</i>, and to these they tie bunches of croton leaves. When the
<i>emone</i> is being built in anticipation of a big feast, these poles
are like, and in fact are part of the series of, the poles erected for
the purpose of the feast, as above described. Croton leaves are also
attached to poles after the repairing of a then existing
<i>emone</i>.</p>
<p>In the case of a new <i>emone</i>, after its completion they light a
fire in it, and in that fire cook a wild pig; vegetable food is
provided, and the clan, including members of the village and of other
villages, have a little clan feast of the vegetables, followed by a
cutting up and distribution of the pig. But there is no dancing.

<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

the custom among the Kuni people when any woman (not merely the wife of
a chief) has her first baby for the women of her own village, and
probably of some neighbouring villages also, to assemble in the village
and to attack her house and the village club-house with darts,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e4838" href="#xd26e4838" name=
"xd26e4838">158</a>]</span>which the women throw with their hands at
the roofs. At Ido-ido I saw that the roofs of the club-house and of
some of the ordinary houses had a number of these darts sticking into
them. The darts were made out of twigs of trees, and were about five or
six feet long; and each of them had a bunch of grass tied in a whorl at
or near its head, and some of them had a similar bunch similarly tied
at or near its middle. See also Dr. Seligmann&rsquo;s reference
(<i>Melanesians of British New Guinea</i>, p. 298) to the Roro custom
for warriors, when returning from a successful campaign, to throw their
spears at the roof and sides of the marea. In Mekeo there is no
corresponding ceremony on the birth of a first child; but men, women
and children of the village collect by the house and sing all through
the night; and in the morning the woman&rsquo;s husband will kill a pig
or dog for them, which they cook and eat without
ceremony.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e4836src">&uarr;</a></p>

Seligmann refers to this custom among the Roro people (<i>Melanesians

exists among the Mekeo people also. Father Desnoes, of the Sacred Heart
Mission, told me that in Mekeo, though the pig used to be given when
the boy adopted his perineal band at the age of four, five, six, or
seven, it is now generally given earlier. The pig is there regarded as
the price paid for the child, and is called the child&rsquo;s <i lang=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Matrimonial and Sexual</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A boy is regarded as having reached a marriageable age
at about 16, 17, or 18, and the age for a girl is a few years younger.
They do not as a rule marry before they have received their perineal
bands; but there does not appear to be any definite custom against
their doing so; nor are there any acts which must be performed to
qualify for marriage, nor any indications by dress or ornament or
otherwise that a boy or girl has attained a marriageable age.</p>
<p>Marriages are usually contracted with women of another community,
though sometimes the wife will belong to a village of another clan in
the same community. Very rarely only is she of another village of the
same clan, and still more rarely is she of the same village, clan
exogamy being the rule, and marriages within the clan, and still more
within the village, being regarded as irregular and undesirable, and
people who have contracted them being considered as having clone
wrong.</p>
<p>There does not appear to be any system of special matrimonial
relationship between any communities; and the mode described below, by
which a youth will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5032" href=
"#xd26e5032" name="xd26e5032">169</a>]</span>by lighting a fire decide
in which direction he must travel to seek a wife, would be hardly
consistent with any such system.</p>
<p>They have their prohibitive rules of consanguinity; but these are
based merely upon the number of generations between either party and
the common ancestor. The number of degrees within which prohibition
applies in this way is two, thus taking it to the grandparent; and the
result is that no man or woman may properly marry any descendant of his
or her paternal or maternal grandfather or grandmother, however distant
the actual relationship of the persons concerned may be.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5036src" href="#xd26e5036" name="xd26e5036src">1</a>
Marriages within the prohibited degree do in fact occur; but they are
discountenanced, and are rare.</p>
<p>Polygyny is usual, and is largely practised. A man will often have
two or three, or sometimes even four, wives; and a chief or rich man
may have as many as six. In the case of an ordinary person the wives
all live with their husband in the same house; but a chief or rich
person may have two or more houses. A man who is already married, and
then marries again, goes through a formality, if it may be so called,
similar to that of a first marriage. Opposition from the first wife
sometimes occurs, but this is unusual. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5044" href="#xd26e5044" name="xd26e5044">170</a>]</span></p>
<p>Infant betrothals are common; but they are quite informal, and not
the subject of any ceremony. The parents in such cases, whether of the
same or different communities, are usually intimate friends, and are
thus led to offer their children to each other for intermarriage. There
is a known case of a girl of 16 or 17 years of age, who was what I can
only call betrothed to the unborn son of a chief. A curious element in
this case was that at the date, prior to the birth of the proposed
husband, of what I call the betrothal, the price for the girl was
actually paid&mdash;a thing which is never done till the
marriage&mdash;and that, as I was most solemnly assured, the living
girl and the unborn boy were in fact regarded, not merely as betrothed,
but as actually married, and that, when the boy died, which he did in
infancy, long before marital relationship between them was possible,
the girl was regarded as being a widow. I could not ascertain what
happened as regards the price which had been paid for the girl. A
couple betrothed in childhood are not subject to any restrictions as to
meeting and mutual companionship, nor is there any mutual avoidance,
nor any increased probability, based on their betrothal, of immorality
between them; though in the more usual case of betrothal between
children of different communities they in ordinary course are not
likely to be constantly seeing each other.</p>
<p>A young man will speak of his sweetheart, present or prospective, as
his <i>ojande</i>, which means his &ldquo;flower&rdquo;; and this is so
even if he does not yet know her; and, when asked where he is going, he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5052" href="#xd26e5052" name=
"xd26e5052">171</a>]</span>will reply that he is going to seek an
<i>ojande</i>. If he is not already betrothed, and is matrimonially
inclined, he has various expedients for accomplishing his desires. A
boy who wants to marry, and does not know where to seek a wife, will
sometimes light a fire in the bush, or better still in an open space
(not in the village), when the air is still, and wait until a slight
breeze blows the flame or smoke a little in some one direction; and he
will then select a community or village which lies in that direction as
the spot in which to seek a wife.</p>
<p>A boy will often carry in a small bag (this does not refer to the
special small charm bag already described) some pieces of wood and
stone, and will rub a piece of tobacco between two of these, and send
this tobacco to the girl of his choice through a female relative of
hers or some other friend; and he believes that in some mysterious way
this will draw her heart towards him, and make her accept him. The
pieces of wood and stone need not be of any particular kind; but he
will have carried them for a considerable time, until they have, as he
thinks, acquired the specific odour of his body; and it is then that
they have obtained their special power. It is impossible to induce a
boy to part with a piece of wood or stone which has been so seasoned by
time, and would take long to replace. Sometimes a boy will acquire
these things by purchase from a magic man, who professes to be able to
impart to them a more effective power. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5059" href="#xd26e5059" name="xd26e5059">172</a>]</span></p>
<p>A proposal of marriage is usually made by the boy through some
female relative of the girl, or other suitable person, and not directly
by him to the girl herself.</p>
<p>Another custom may be mentioned here, though it only relates to a
man who is already married, but wants another wife or wives. In
clearing the bush for yam gardens it is usual, as regards the smaller
trees, to cut away the side branches only, leaving the main trunks for
posts up which the yams will climb; but the man in question will in the
case of one (only one) of these smaller trees leave uncut one, two, or
three of the upper branches, the number so left being the number of the
wives he desires; and everyone understands its meaning.</p>
<p>As regards the relationship of unmarried boys and girls generally,
they are allowed to associate together, without any special precautions
to prevent misconduct, and a good deal of general immorality
exists.</p>
<p>The marriage ceremony, following a parental betrothal, or with
parental acquiescence, is a very informal matter, and in fact both the
bargaining for the wife and the ceremony of the marriage are in
striking contrast to the elaborate system of bargaining and mock
raiding by the girl&rsquo;s family, and the wedding ceremonies, which
are adopted in Mekeo. A day is fixed for the marriage, and on that day
the boy goes to the house of the girl&rsquo;s parents, after which he
and she and her parents go to the house of the boy&rsquo;s parents, and
the girl is paid for then and there. After this the young people
immediately live together <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5069"
href="#xd26e5069" name="xd26e5069">173</a>]</span>as a married couple
in the house of either his or her parents, until he has been able to
build a house for himself. Neither are there any special ceremonies in
connection with the fixing of the price. This is generally very small.
Dogs&rsquo; teeth, pearl shell, necklaces, adzes, etc., are the usual
things in which it is paid; but there is always a pig, which has been
killed under, or on the site of, the grave platform above referred to.
The price, in fact, depends upon the position and wealth of the
girl&rsquo;s parents, except that there is always only one pig. The
price is paid to the father of the girl, or, if dead, to her eldest
brother or other nearest male paternal relative.</p>
<p>A runaway marriage is still simpler. The boy has proposed to the
girl through her friend, and she has consented; and they simply run off
into the bush together, and remain in the bush, or the gardens, or a
distant village, until the boy&rsquo;s friends have succeeded in
propitiating the girl&rsquo;s father, and the price has been paid; and
then the couple return to the village.</p>
<p>After marriage, the husband and wife are not as a rule faithful to
each other, the marriage tie being only slight. Adultery on the part of
the wife, but not of the husband, is regarded as a serious offence, if
discovered. The injured husband will beat the guilty wife, and is
entitled to kill the man with whom she has misconducted herself, and
will usually do so; though nowadays he often dares not do so in
districts where he fears Government punishment. Sometimes he will be
content if the adulterer pays him a big <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5075" href="#xd26e5075" name="xd26e5075">174</a>]</span>price,
say a pig; and this compensation is now commonly accepted in districts
where the husband dares not kill. In either case, the husband generally
keeps the wife.</p>
<p>Formal divorce or separation does not exist. A husband who wants to
get rid of his wife will make her life so miserable that she runs away
from him. But more usually the separation originates with the wife,
who, not liking or being tired of her husband, or being in love
elsewhere, will run away and elope altogether with another man. In such
a case, the husband may retaliate on that other man in the way already
mentioned; but that is rather the method adopted in cases of incidental
adultery, and as a rule, when the wife actually elopes, she and her
paramour go off to some other community, and the husband submits to the
loss. He will, however, claim from the wife&rsquo;s people the price
which he paid for her on his marriage. This is sometimes paid, but not
always; and, as the wife almost always belongs to another clan, and
generally to another community, the refusal to pay this claim is one of
the frequent causes of fighting, the members of the husband&rsquo;s
clan, and often the whole community, joining him in a punitive
expedition.</p>
<p>When a man dies, or at all events after the removal by the widow of
her mourning, she goes back to her own people, generally taking with
her any of their young children who are then living in the house. There
is no devolution of the wife to the husband&rsquo;s brother, or
anything of that nature. Nor, in case of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5081" href="#xd26e5081" name="xd26e5081">175</a>]</span>the death
of the wife, does the husband marry her sister.</p>
<p>Speaking of the people generally, it may certainly be said that
sexual morality among men, women, boys and girls is very low; and there
is no punishment for immorality, except as above stated. <span class=

According to Dr. Seligmann, among the Koita the forbidden degrees of
relationship extend to third cousins (<i>Melanesians of British New
Guinea</i>, p. 82); whereas it will be seen that among the Mafulu it
only extends, as between people of the same generation, to first
cousins. But a Mafulu native who was grandson of the common ancestor
would be prohibited from marrying his first cousin once removed
(great-granddaughter of that ancestor) or his first cousin twice
removed (great-great-granddaughter of that ancestor).&nbsp;<a class=

<h3 class="main">Killing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Individual killing in personal quarrel, as
distinguished from slaying in warfare, is exceedingly rare, except in
cases of revenge upon adulterers. In these cases, however, it is
regarded as the appropriate punishment; and even the family of the
adulterer would hardly retaliate, if satisfied as to his guilt. There
is no system of head-hunting, or of killing victims in connection with
any ceremonies, or of burying alive,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5094src" href="#xd26e5094" name="xd26e5094src">1</a> or of
killing old and sick people, though the ceremonial blow on the head of
a reputed dying man must sometimes be premature.</p>
<p>Abortion and infanticide, however, are exceedingly common, the more
usual practice being that of procuring abortion. Although sexual
immorality so largely exists, and young unmarried women and girls are
known to indulge in it so freely, and it is not seriously reprobated,
it is regarded as a disgrace for one to give birth to a child; and if
she gets into trouble she will procure abortion or kill the child. The
same thing is also common among married <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5102" href="#xd26e5102" name="xd26e5102">177</a>]</span>women, on
the ground that they do not wish to have more children. There is
another cause for this among married women, which is peculiar. A woman
must not give birth to a child until she has given a pig to a village
feast; and if she does so it will be a matter of reproach to her. If,
therefore, she finds herself about to have a child, and there is no
festal opportunity for her to give a pig, or if, though there be a
feast, she cannot afford to give a pig, she will probably procure
abortion or kill the child when born. I was told by Father Chabot, the
Father Superior of the Mission, that among the neighbouring Kuni people
a woman would kill her child for extraordinary reasons; and he
furnished an example of this in a woman who killed her child so that
she might use her milk for suckling a young pig, which was regarded as
being more important. Whether such a thing would occur in Mafulu
appears to be doubtful; but it is quite possible, more especially as
the Mafulu women do, in fact, suckle pigs.</p>
<p>Abortion is induced by taking the heavy stone mallet used for bark
cloth beating, and striking the woman on the front of the body over the
womb. It is also assisted by the wearing of the tight cane belt already
mentioned. I could not hear of any system of using drugs or herbs to
procure abortion; but herbs are used to produce general sterility,
which they are believed to be effective in doing.</p>
<p>Married women also often kill their children as the result of a sort
of superstitious ceremony. The child being born, the mother, in
accordance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5108" href="#xd26e5108"
name="xd26e5108">178</a>]</span>with the custom of the country, goes
down to the river, and throws the placenta into it. She then, however,
often takes a little water from the river, and gives it to the babe. If
the latter seems by the movements of its lips and tongue to accept and
take the water into its mouth, it is a sign that it is to live, and it
is allowed to do so. If not, it is a sign that it is to die, and she
throws it into the river. This custom, which is quite common, has
presumably had a superstitious origin, and it seems to be practised
with superstitious intent now. There appears, however, to be no doubt
that it is also followed for the purpose of keeping or killing the
child, according to the wish of the mother. There is further,
confirming the last statement, a well-known practice, when the mother
goes down to the river with her baby, for some other woman, who is
childless and desires a child, to accompany the mother, and take from
her and adopt the baby; and as to this, there is no doubt that, before
doing so, the woman ascertains from the mother whether or not she
intends to keep her child, and only goes with her to the river if she
does not intend to keep it. This is done quite openly, with the full
knowledge of the second woman&rsquo;s husband and friends; and everyone
knows that the child is not really hers, and how she acquired
it.<a class="noteref" id="n178.1src" href="#n178.1" name=

<h3 class="main">Cannibalism.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is no doubt that the Mafulu people have always
been cannibals, and are so still, subject now to the fear in which they
hold the controlling authority of the white man, and which impels such
of them as are in close touch with the latter to indulge in their
practice only in secrecy. Their cannibalism has been, and is, however,
of a restricted character. They do not kill for the purpose of eating;
and they only eat bodies of people who have been intentionally killed,
not the bodies of those who have been killed by accident, or died a
natural death. Also the victim eaten is always a member of another
community. The killing which is followed by eating is always a hostile
killing in fight; but this fight may be either a personal and
individual one, or it may be a community battle. The idea of eating the
body appears to be a continued act of hostility, rather than one of
gastronomic enjoyment; and I could learn nothing of any belief as to
acquiring the valour and power of the deceased by eating him. I was
informed that the man who has killed the victim will never himself
share in the eating of him, this being the case both as regards people
killed in private personal fighting and those killed in war.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5119src" href="#xd26e5119" name="xd26e5119src">3</a>
I tried to find out if there were any ceremonies connected with the
eating of human flesh; but could learn nothing upon the subject, the
natives being naturally not readily communicative with white men on the
matter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5122" href="#xd26e5122"

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Warfare.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Warfare generally occurs between one community or
section of a community (probably a clan) and another community or
section of one; it very rarely occurs within a community. Sometimes two
communities join together in opposition to a third one; but alliances
of this sort are usually only of a temporary character. War among these
people is now, of course, forbidden by the British authorities, and
indulgence in it is a serious punishable offence; but it cannot be said
to be abolished.</p>
<p>The usual ground for an attack is either that some member of the
attacked community or section of a community has by personal violence
or by spirit-supported sorcery killed a member of the attacking
community or section, or it is of the matrimonial character above
explained. The underlying idea of the war is a life for a life; and in
the matrimonial matter one life is the sum of vengeance required. Hence
the primary object of an attack has usually been accomplished when the
attacking party has killed one of their opponents. If there are two or
more persons whose deaths have to be avenged, a corresponding number of
lives is required in the battle. Then the attacking party may suffer
loss during the fight, in which case this has to be added to the
account; and loss by the attacked is introduced into the other side of
it to their credit. The number killed in a battle is not, however,
often great.</p>
<p>When the required vengeance has been accomplished, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5132" href="#xd26e5132" name=
"xd26e5132">181</a>]</span>the attacking party usually cease fighting
and return home, if the enemy allow them to do so. They may retire
before their vengeance has been accomplished; but in that case they are
probably doing so as a defeated party, with the intention of renewing
the attack on a subsequent occasion. If the attacking party cease
fighting and try to return, the enemy may continue their counter
attack, especially if they have themselves suffered loss in the
fighting; but I was told that the enemy would not as a rule follow the
attacking party far into the bush. It may be that what is regarded by
the attackers as a correct balance of lives struck, on which they may
retire, is not so regarded by the enemy, in which case the latter may
try to prolong the fight; and, if the attackers get away, there will
probably be a retaliatory expedition, in which the position of
attackers and attacked is reversed. The primary idea of a life for a
life is, however, generally understood and acknowledged; and if the
enemy recognise the truth of the alleged reason for the attack, and
have not lost more life than was required to balance the account, they
usually rest satisfied with the result.</p>
<p>No ceremony or taboo appears to be adopted in anticipation of
proposed hostilities for the purpose of securing success; but
individual fighters often wear charms, upon whose efficacy they rely.
Nor do there appear to be any omens in connection with them other than
certain general ones to be referred to hereafter. The preparations for
a fight and its conduct can hardly be regarded as subjects of much
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5136" href="#xd26e5136" name=
"xd26e5136">182</a>]</span>organisation, as the chiefs are not war
chiefs, and there are no recognised permanent leaders or commanders of
the forces, and no recognised war councils or systematic organisation,
either of the fighting party or of the conduct of the fight. All adult
males of the community engaged are expected to take part, and the
leadership will generally fall upon someone who at the moment is
regarded as a strong and wise fighter.</p>
<p>The men start off on their expedition as an armed, but unorganised,
body, their arms being spears, bows and arrows,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5140src" href="#xd26e5140" name="xd26e5140src">4</a> clubs, adzes
and shields, and none of their weapons being poisoned. During their
progress to the enemy&rsquo;s community they are generally singing, and
their song relates to the grievance the avenging of which is the object
of the expedition. The warriors do not, I was told, as a rule carry a
full supply of provisions, as they rely largely upon what they can find
in the bush, and what they hope to raid from their enemy&rsquo;s
plantations. On reaching the scene of battle they adopt methods of
spying and scouting and sentry duty, though only on simple and
unscientific lines. They have apparently no generally recognised
systems of signs of truce or truce envoys or hostages. There are
certain recognised cries, which respectively signify the killing of a
man and the taking of a prisoner, by which, when such an event occurs,
the fighters on both sides are aware of it. An enemy wounded on the
battlefield <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5146" href="#xd26e5146"
name="xd26e5146">183</a>]</span>may be killed at once or may be taken
prisoner. All prisoners, wounded or otherwise, are taken home by the
party that secures them, and are then killed, apparently without any
prior torture, and generally eaten. A prisoner thus carried off would
be regarded as a man killed, which in fact he shortly will be. The
women of a community follow their fighting men in the expedition, their
duty being to encourage the fighters on the way out, and during the
fight, by their singing; but they remain in the rear during the battle,
and do not actually fight. These women, of course, also run the risk of
being killed or wounded or taken prisoners.</p>
<p>Fighting between two communities may go on intermittently for years.
Then perhaps the communities may get mutually weary of it, and decide
to make peace. This act is ratified by an exchange between the two
communities of ceremonial visits, with feasts and pig-killing, but no
dancing, the pigs and vegetables and fruit distributed by the hosts
among the visitors on the return visit being exactly similar in
character and quantity to what the latter have given the former on the
prior visit.</p>
<p>The Mafulu war spears are made out of a very hard-wooded palm tree
and another hard red-wooded tree, the name of which I do not know. They
are round in section, tapering at both ends, and are generally from 10
to 12 feet long, and about three-quarters of an inch in diameter at the
widest part. There are three forms of point. The first (<a href=
"#p073">Plate 73, Fig. 1</a>) is simply a tapering off in round
section. The second <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5155" href=
"#xd26e5155" name="xd26e5155">184</a>]</span>(<a href="#p073">Plate 73,
Fig. 2</a>) is made square in section for a distance of 2 to 2&frac12;
feet from the tip. The third (<a href="#p073">Plate 73, Fig. 3</a>) is
in section a triangle, of which two sides are equal and the other side
is a little larger, this triangular form being carried for a foot or
less from the tip, and the larger surface being barbed bilaterally.
This last-mentioned form is also generally decorated with a little tuft
of bright-coloured feathers, just above the point where the barbing
begins.</p>
<p>The bows (<a href="#p074">Plate 74, Fig. 1</a>) are made of split
bamboo, the convex side of the bow being the inner section of the split
bamboo. These bows are quite short, generally about 4 feet long when
straightened out, and have triangular-shaped knobs at the ends for
holding the bowstrings. The bowstrings are made of what appears to be
strong split canes (not sugar-canes). The arrows (<a href="#p074">Plate
73, Fig. 4</a>) are from 6 to 8 feet long, which is extraordinary in
comparison with the length of the bows, and are made in two parts, the
shaft being made of a strong reed, and the point, which is inserted
into the reed shaft and is generally a foot or more long, being single
and round-sectioned, and made of the same materials as are used for
spears. There are no feathers or equivalents of feathers, and the shaft
end of the arrow is cut square and not notched.</p>
<p>The clubs (<a href="#p075">Plate 75, Figs, 1 and 2</a>) are
stone-headed, the heads being of the pineapple and disc types; but
these heads are the same as those used on the plains and coast, whose
people, in fact, get them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5176"
href="#xd26e5176" name="xd26e5176">185</a>]</span>from the mountains,
and as these are so well-known, it is not necessary for me to describe
them.</p>
<p>The adzes (<a href="#p075">Plate 75, Fig. 4</a>) are of the usual
type, the stone blade being lashed directly on to the handle. There are
two common forms. In one, which is also used for ordinary adze work,
the haft is cut from a natural branch, with the angle of the head part
set obliquely. In the other, which is also used for cutting timber, the
haft is cut from a branch with the angle of the head part set at right
angles, or nearly so. I do not know to what extent this second form is
common in New Guinea. It is not found in Mekeo.</p>
<p>The shields (<a href="#p074">Plate 74, Figs. 2 and 3</a>) are thick,
heavy, cumbrous weapons, made out of the wood used for making wooden
dishes. The outer surfaces are convex, and the inner ones concave, the
natural convexity of the circular trunk of the tree from which they are
made being retained. These shields are 4&frac12; to 5 feet long, and
usually about 15 or 16 inches wide in the broadest central part,
getting somewhat narrower towards the two ends, where they are rounded
off. Each shield has two strong cane handles in the centre of its
internal concave side, each of which handles is fixed by means of two
pairs of holes bored through the shield, and of thongs which are passed
through these holes and attached to the ends of the handles. The
shields are carried by passing the left arm through the upper handle
downwards, the left hand holding the lower handle. <span class=

<h3 class="main">Hunting.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This is engaged in more or less all the year round,
especially as regards wild pigs when wanted for village killing. The
animals chiefly hunted are pigs, kangaroos, wallabies, the
&ldquo;Macgregor bear,&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5199src" href=
"#xd26e5199" name="xd26e5199src">1</a> large snakes, cassowaries and
other birds.</p>
<p>The hunting weapons and contrivances used are spears, bows and
arrows, nets and traps; but adzes and clubs are used in connection with
net hunting. The spears are those used for war. The bows and arrows
employed for hunting animals and cassowaries are also the same as those
used for war; but these are not much used. For bird-shooting (excluding
cassowary-shooting) they generally use arrows (<a href="#p073">Plate
73, Fig. 5</a>) the points of which are made of four rather fine pieces
of bamboo cane, closely bound together at the place of insertion into
the reed shaft, and also bound together further down, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5207" href="#xd26e5207" name=
"xd26e5207">187</a>]</span>but with a piece of stick or some other
material inserted between them inside this second binding, so as to
keep them a little apart and make them spread outwards, thus producing
a four-pronged point. The arrows vary in length from 5 to 6 or 7 feet,
and their points vary from 4 to 10 inches. The adzes and clubs are the
same as those used for war.</p>
<p>The people generally hunt in large parties for pigs (hunted with
either spears or nets), kangaroos and wallabies (hunted with nets
only), and Macgregor bears, cassowaries, and big snakes (hunted with
spears only). The hunters may be members of a single village or of a
whole community. They generally return home on the same day, except
when hunting the Macgregor bear, which is only found on the tops of
high mountains, and so requires a longer expedition. They usually take
out with them large numbers of young boys, who are not armed, and do
not take part in the actual killing, but who, when the party reaches
the hunting ground, spread out in the bush, and so find the animals.
While doing this the boys bark like dogs. Sometimes dogs are taken
instead, but this is unusual, as they have not many dogs.</p>
<p>A preliminary ceremony is performed by a person whose special duty
it is, and who, I think, is usually the pig-killer. He takes a
particular kind of fragrant grass, makes an incantation over it, rubs
it on the noses of the dogs (if there are any),<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5213src" href="#xd26e5213" name="xd26e5213src">2</a> and then
ties it in several <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5219" href=
"#xd26e5219" name="xd26e5219">188</a>]</span>portions to the meshes of
the net to be used. If there are dogs, but no net, then, after rubbing
the dogs&rsquo; noses, he throws the grass away. If there is a net, but
no clogs, then, after making the incantation, he ties the grass on to
the net as above mentioned. This appears to be the only ceremony in
connection with hunting; and there is no food or other taboo associated
with it, but some of the charms worn are intended to give success in
hunting.</p>
<p>In spear hunting, when children and not dogs are employed, the
children shout as soon as the animal has been found, and then retreat;
and, when the animal has been found by either children or dogs, the
hunting men attack it with their spears, if possible surrounding
it.</p>
<p>In net hunting, which of course can only be adopted in fairly open
spaces, the hunters place their net by means of pole supports in the
form of a crescent, perhaps as much as 50 or 60 yards long, this
length, however, requiring several nets put end to end together, and 2
or 3 feet high. The net is generally put across the base of a narrow
ravine, or across a narrow ridge, these being the routes along which
the animals usually travel. The children or dogs search for the animal,
as in spear hunting; and when it is found, most of the hunters place
themselves in a crescent-shaped formation behind the animal, so that it
is between them and the net, and then gradually close in upon it, and
so drive it into the net. Behind the net are other hunters, more or
less hidden, who kill the animal with club or adze when it is caught in
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5225" href="#xd26e5225" name=
"xd26e5225">189</a>]</span>net. They sometimes use spears in the event
of an animal jumping over the net, and so trying to escape; though in
net hunting the spears are more especially carried for purposes of
self-defence in case of an attack by the animal.</p>
<p>There is always an enormous amount of shouting all through the hunt.
When the animal has been caught, they generally kill it then and there,
except as regards pigs required alive for village ceremony, and which
are disabled, but not killed. The huntings, except when pigs are
specially required, are usually general; and when any sort of animal
has been killed the hunters are content. They surround the beast, and
make three loud shouting screams, by which the people of the village or
community know, not only that an animal has been killed, but also what
the animal is. It is then brought home, and eaten by the whole village,
if the hunt be a village hunt, or by the community, if it be a
community hunt.</p>
<p>Individual hunting, in which I include hunts by parties of two or
three, is also common. Solitary hunters are generally only searching
for birds (not cassowaries); but parties of two or three will go after
larger game, such as pigs, cassowaries, etc. Such parties hunt the
larger game with spears, clubs and adzes, and shoot the birds, other
than cassowaries, with bows and arrows. They kill their victims as they
can, and bring them home; and they, and probably some of their friends,
eat them.</p>
<p>Trap hunting is much engaged in by single individuals. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5233" href="#xd26e5233" name=
"xd26e5233">190</a>]</span>A common form of trap used for pigs is a
round hole about 6 feet deep and 2 feet in diameter, which is dug in
the ground anywhere in the usual tracks of the pigs, and is covered
over with rotten wood, upon which grass is spread; and into this hole
the pig falls and cannot get out. The maker of the hole does not
necessarily stay by it, but will visit it from time to time in the hope
of having caught a pig. Small tree-climbing animals are often caught by
a plan based upon the inclination of an animal, seeing a continuous
line, to go along it. A little pathway of sticks is laid along the
ground, commencing near a suitable tree, and carried up to the base of
that tree, and then taken up the trunk, and along a branch, on which it
terminates, the parts upon the tree being bound to it with cane. At the
branch termination of this path is either a noose trap, made out of a
piece of native string tied at one end to the branch, and having at the
other end a running noose in which the animal is caught, or a very
primitive baitless framework trap, so made that the animal, having once
got into it, cannot get out again. Or instead of a trap, the man will
erect a small rough platform upon the same tree, upon which platform he
waits, perhaps all night, until the animal comes, and then shoots it
with his bow and arrow. Another form of trap for small animals is a
sort of alley along the ground, fenced in on each side by a palisading
of sticks, and having at its end a heavy overhanging piece of wood,
supported by an easily moved piece of stick, which the animal, after
passing along the alley, disturbs, so bringing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5235" href="#xd26e5235" name=
"xd26e5235">191</a>]</span>down the piece of wood on to the top of it;
this trap also has no bait. Large snakes are caught in nooses attached
to the ground or hanging from trees.</p>
<p>Birds of all kinds, except cassowaries, are killed with bows and
arrows. There is also a method of killing certain kinds of birds of
paradise which dance on branches of trees, and certain other kinds and
bower birds, which dance on the ground,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5239src" href="#xd26e5239" name="xd26e5239src">3</a> by means of
nooses as above described, these being tied to the branch of the tree,
or, in the case of ground nooses, tied to a stick or something in the
ground. The natives know the spots where the birds are dancing, and
place the noose traps there. Another method of killing birds is adopted
on narrow forest-covered ridges of the mountains. An open space or
passage about 2 or 3 yards wide is cut in the bush, across the ridge;
and across this passage are suspended three parallel nets, the inner or
central one being of a close and impassable mesh, and the two outer
ones having a mesh so far open that a bird striking against it can get
through. These nets are made of very fine material, and so are not
easily seen, especially as they are more or less in shade from the
trees on each side of the passage. A bird flying from the valley on
either side towards the ridge is attracted by this open passage, and
flies into and along it; it strikes against one of the more open outer
nets, and gets through it, but is confused and bewildered, and so is
easily <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5242" href="#xd26e5242" name=

<h3 class="main">Fishing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Fishing is carried on by the Mafulu people by means of
weirs placed across streams, the weirs having open sluices with
intercepting nets, and smaller nets being used to catch such fish as
escape the big ones. They do not fish with spears, hooks, or bows and
arrows, or with fishing lines, as is done in Mekeo; and even their weir
and net systems are different from the Mekeo ones. Fishing with them is
more or less communistic, as it is generally engaged in by parties of
ten or twenty men (women do not fish), and sometimes nearly all the men
of a village, or even of a community, join in a fishing expedition; and
everyone in the village or community shares more or less in the spoil.
The fishing season is towards the end of the dry season, say in October
or November, when work in the gardens is over, and the rivers are low.
I cannot give the names of the fishes caught, but was told that the
chief ones are large full-bodied carp-like fish and eels.</p>
<p>The large weir nets are simply ordinary frameless nets about 3 to 5
yards long, and 1 yard wide, with a fairly small mesh. The smaller ones
are hand nets, made in two forms. One of these is made of ordinary fine
netting, and is bag-shaped, being strung on a round looped end of cane,
of which the other end is the handle, the net being about the size of a
good-sized <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5251" href="#xd26e5251"
name="xd26e5251">193</a>]</span>butterfly net. The other form is also
framed on a looped cane; but the loop in this case is larger and more
oval in shape, and the netting is made of the web of a large spider. To
make it they take the already looped cane to where there are a number
of such webs, and twist the looped end round and round among the webs,
until there is stretched across the loop a double or treble or
quadruple layer of web, which, though flat when made, is elastic, and
when used becomes under pressure more or less bag-shaped.</p>
<p>The fishers first make a weir of upright sticks placed close
together among the stones in the river bed, the weir stretching across
the greater part of, or sometimes only half-way across, the river. The
side of the river left open and undammed is filled up with stones to
such a height that the water flowing over it is shallow, and the fish
do not escape across it. In the middle of the weir they leave an open
space or sluice, behind which they fasten the big net.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5255src" href="#xd26e5255" name="xd26e5255src">4</a>
<a href="#p076">Plate 76</a> shows a weir on the Aduala river, a
portion of the open sluice being seen on the left. After forming the
weir, but before fixing the net, the fishers all join in a sort of
prayer or invocation to the river. For example, on the Aduala river
they will say, &ldquo;Aduala, give us plenty of fish, that we may eat
well.&rdquo; This is the only ceremony in connection with the fishing,
and there is no food or other taboo associated with it; but here again
charms are often relied upon. The big net <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5261" href="#xd26e5261" name="xd26e5261">194</a>]</span>catches
most of the fish which are carried down by the rush of water through
the opening in the weir; but a group of fishermen stand round it with
their hand nets, with which they catch any fish that leap out of the
big net, and would otherwise escape, the ordinary hand nets being
usually used for larger fish, and the cobweb ones for the smaller fish.
They often have two or three of these weirs in the same stream, at some
little distance from each other.</p>
<p>A fishing party will often stay and live for some days at the place
where they are fishing, and eat the fish each day as they catch it; so
that what they bring home for the village or community may only be the
result of the last day&rsquo;s sport. But the women will sometimes come
to the fishers, bring them food, and take some fish back to the village
or community. Each community has waters which it regards as being its
own; but disputes as to this apparently do not arise.</p>
<p>A solitary individual sometimes goes off to catch fish with one of
the hand nets above described or with his hands, and eats or keeps what
he catches; but this is unusual.</p>

<h3 class="main">Agriculture.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Agriculture is never communistic, being entirely an
individual or family matter, men and households and families having
their own gardens and plantations. The trees and plants chiefly
cultivated are those already mentioned as being used for food.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5272" href="#xd26e5272" name=
"xd26e5272">195</a>]</span></p>
<p>The clearing of the ground is done by men, and is begun about the
end of June. The trees and their branches are used for fencing, the
fencing being also done by men. The clearing away of the undergrowth is
done by women, who pile it in small heaps, which are spread over the
cleared space, being so close together that they almost touch one
another. When these have got quite dry, which may be in a few days, or
not for some time, they burn them, and the ashes add fertility to the
soil. There is no general digging up of the ground, as distinguished
from the digging of holes for individual plants. The clearing of the
trees is done with stone adzes, or in difficult cases by fire; but some
of the people now have European axes, of which some have been acquired
from white men, and some from plain and coast natives. In clearing for
planting yam and plants of the yam type they leave the upright stems of
some of the trees and shrubby undergrowth for the yams, etc., to trail
over. Cultivation of some of the more usual plants is done as
follows.</p>
<p>Sweet potatoes and vegetables of similar type are planted by the
women in August and September. They make little holes in the ground
about 2 feet apart, and in them plant the potatoes, the roots used
being the young sarmentose runners, which they cut off from the parent
plants, the latter being merely cut down to the ground, and the old
tubers being left in it. These runners are left to grow, and in about
three or four months the young potatoes are ready for eating, and
afterwards there will be a continuous supply from the runners. The
digging up of the day-to-day <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5277"
href="#xd26e5277" name="xd26e5277">196</a>]</span>supply of potatoes is
done by the women, the work in this, and in all other digging, being
done with small pointed sticks, roughly made and not preserved; though
now they sometimes have European knives, these knives and axes being
the two European implements which they use in agriculture, if they
possess them.</p>
<p>Yams and similar vegetables are planted by men in August and
September, near to the young tree stems up which they are to trail, and
at distances apart of 2 or 3 yards. In this case, however, there are
two plantings. In the first instance the yam tubers are planted in
pretty deep holes, the tubers being long. The yams then grow, and twine
over the tree stems, and spread. After about ten months the men dig up
the tubers, which in the meantime have grown larger, and cut away from
them all the trailing green growth, and then hang the tubers up in the
houses and <i>emone</i>, to let the new growing points sprout. Then in
about another two months the men replant the smaller tubers, while the
larger ones are retained for food.</p>
<p>There are two curious Mafulu practices in connection with
yam-planting. First, before planting each tuber they wrap round it an
ornamental leaf, such as a croton, which they call the
&ldquo;sweetheart of the yam.&rdquo; Against this leaf they press a
piece of limestone. They then plant the tuber with its sweetheart leaf
around it and the piece of limestone pressing against its side, and
fill in the soil; but as they do the latter they withdraw the piece of
limestone, which they use successively for other yams, and, indeed,
keep in their houses for use <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5286"
href="#xd26e5286" name="xd26e5286">197</a>]</span>year by year. In the
villages near the Mafulu Mission Station the limestone used is
generally a piece of stalactite, which they get from the limestone
caves in the mountains. The belief is that by planting in this way the
yams will grow stronger and better. Secondly, there is a little
small-leafed plant of a spreading nature, only a few inches high, which
grows wild in the mountains, but which is also cultivated, and a patch
of which they always plant in a yam plantation. This plant they also
call the &ldquo;sweetheart of the yam&rdquo;; and they believe that its
presence is beneficial to the plantation.</p>
<p>Yams are ready for supplying food eight or ten months after
planting. They are not, like the potatoes, dug up from day to day, as
they can be stored. The usual period of digging and storing is about
June or July, and this digging is done by both men and women, the
former dealing with the larger yams, which are difficult to get up, and
the latter with the smaller ones.</p>
<p>The yam is apparently regarded by the Mafulu people as a vegetable
possessing an importance which one is tempted to think may have a more
or less superstitious origin-witness the facts that only men may plant
it and that it is the only vegetable in the planting of which
superstitious methods are employed, and the special methods and
ceremonies adopted in the hanging of the yams at the big feast. But I
fancy this idea as to the yam is not confined to the Mafulu; and indeed
Chalmers tells us of a Motu superstition which attributes to it a human
origin;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5292src" href="#xd26e5292" name=
"xd26e5292src">5</a> and a perusal <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5297" href="#xd26e5297" name="xd26e5297">198</a>]</span>of the
chapter on sacrifices in Dr. Codrington&rsquo;s book, <i>The
Melanesians</i>, leaves the impression on one&rsquo;s mind that among
these people the yam is the one vegetable which is specially used for
sacrificial purposes.</p>
<p>Taro and similar vegetables are planted by women in August and
September among the yams, at distances of 2 or 3 feet apart. For this
purpose they take the young secondary growths which crop up round the
main central plants during the year.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5304src" href="#xd26e5304" name="xd26e5304src">6</a> They are
ready for eating in, say, May or June of the following year. They are
dug up by women from day to day as wanted, as they, like the sweet
potato, cannot be kept, as the yams are, after being taken up. There
is, however, a method when the taro is ripe and needs digging up, but
is not then required for eating, of making a large hole in the ground,
filling it with grass, digging up the taro, putting it on the grass in
the hole, covering and surrounding it with more grass, and then filling
up with soil, and so preserving the taro for future use by a sort of
ensilage system. I was told that this was not done on the plains.</p>
<p>Bananas are planted by men, this being done every year, and off and
on all through the year, generally in old potato gardens. In this case
they take the young offshoots, which break out near the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5309" href="#xd26e5309" name=
"xd26e5309">199</a>]</span>bases of the stems. The closeness of
planting varies considerably. The fruit is gathered all through the
year by men. A banana will generally begin to bear fruit about twelve
months after planting, though some sorts of banana take as long as two
years.</p>
<p>Sugar-cane is planted by men off and on during the whole year,
generally in old potato gardens, the growing points at the tops of the
canes being put into the ground at distances of 5 or 6 feet apart. Each
plant produces a number of canes, and these begin to be edible after
six or eight months. They are then cut for eating by both men and
women.</p>
<p>As regards both banana and sugar-cane, the people, after planting
them in the potato gardens, allow the potatoes to still go on growing
and spreading; but these potatoes are merely used for the pigs, the
people only eating those grown in their open patches.</p>
<p>Beans of a big coarse-growing sort, with large pods from 8 to 18
inches long, are planted by women about September by the garden fences
of the potato and yam gardens, and allowed to creep up these fences.
They furnish edible fruit in about three or four months from the time
of planting, and are then gathered by the women. Only the inside seeds
are eaten (not the pod); and even these are so hard that
twenty&mdash;four hours&rsquo; boiling does not soften
them&mdash;indeed, they are usually roasted.</p>
<p>Pandanus trees are grown in the bush and not in the gardens. The
<i>ine</i> which is a large form (<a href="#p080">Plate 80</a>), is
always grown at a height of not less than 5,000 feet; but there is a
smaller one which is grown <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5326"
href="#xd26e5326" name="xd26e5326">200</a>]</span>by a river or stream.
The <i>malage</i> is always grown in the valleys near brooks and
rivers.</p>
<p>As regards the gardens generally, they may be roughly divided into
sweet potato gardens and yam gardens. In the former are also grown
bananas, sugar-cane, beans, pumpkin, cucumber and maize; and in the
latter taro and beans, and the reed plant with the asparagus flavour to
which I have already referred. The general tending of the bananas and
sugar-canes, and to a certain extent the yams, is done by men; but in
other respects the garden produce is looked after by women, who also
attend to the weeding and keeping of the gardens clean, the men looking
after the fences.</p>
<p>Having planted a certain crop in a garden, they let it go on until
it is exhausted, the period for this being different for different
crops; but afterwards they never again plant the same crop in the same
garden. When a crop is exhausted, they may possibly use the same garden
for some other purpose; but as a rule they do not do so, except as
regards the use of old potato gardens for banana and sugar-cane. When
fresh gardens are wanted, fresh portions of bush are cleared; and the
old deserted gardens are quickly re-covered by nature with fresh bush,
the growth of vegetation being very rapid. Most of the gardens are bush
gardens, and, though these may sometimes be close to the village, you
do not find a regular system of gardens within the village clearing, as
you do in the Mekeo district, the situations of the villages being
indeed hardly adapted for this. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I put the two processes of bark cloth making and
netting together, as being the only forms in which material is made in
pieces of substantial size.</p>
<p>Bark cloth is used for making perineal bands, men&rsquo;s caps,
illness-recovery capes, bark cloth head strings, mourning strings and
dancing aprons and ribbons. Netting is used for fishing and hunting
nets, sleeping hammocks, the various forms of carrying bags and the
mourning vests worn by the widows of chiefs.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Bark Cloth Making.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Bark cloth is made by both men and women out of the
bark of three different kinds of tree; but I do not know what these
are. They strip the bark from the tree, and from the bark they strip
off the outer layer, leaving the inner fibrous layer, which is about
&#8539;th of an inch in thickness. They have no method of fastening two
pieces of bark or cloth together, so every garment has to be a single
piece, and the size of the piece to be made depends upon the purpose
for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5351" href="#xd26e5351" name=
"xd26e5351">202</a>]</span>which it is wanted. The cloth is made in the
usual way by soaking the prepared bark in water for about twenty-four
hours, and then hammering it with a heavy mallet upon the rounded
surface of a cut-down tree trunk (<a href="#p079">Plate 79</a>).</p>
<p>The mallet used (<a href="#p051">Plate 51, Fig. 3</a>), however,
differs from the wooden mallet of Mekeo and the coast. It is a heavy
black roller-shaped piece of stone, tapering a little at one or both
ends, and being broader at the beating end than at the holding end. It
varies in length from 10 to 18 inches, and has a maximum width of about
2 or 2&frac12; inches. The beating surface is not flattened, as is the
case with the Mekeo beaters, but it is rather deeply scored with a
series of longitudinal and transverse lines, crossing each other at
right angles, or nearly so. This scoring generally covers a surface
space of about 3 inches by 1 or 2 inches, and is done with pointed
pieces of similar stone, or with the tusks of wild pigs.</p>
<p>As the hammering proceeds the bark becomes thinner and larger in
surface, and when this process is finished, the cloth is hung up to
dry.</p>
<p>The colouring of the cloth, if and when this is added, is done by
men only, and, like body-staining, is nearly always in either red,
yellow, or black. The red stain is obtained from the two sorts of earth
used for red face and body-staining, being, as in the other case, mixed
with water or animal fat, so as to produce a paste. Another source of
red stain used for cloth is the fruit of a wild tree growing in the
bush, which fruit they chew and spit out. I do not know what the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5365" href="#xd26e5365" name=
"xd26e5365">203</a>]</span>tree is, but I do not think it is the
Pandanus, whose fruit is, I believe, used for body-staining. The yellow
stain is obtained from the root of a plant which I understand to be
rather like a ginger. They dry the root in the sun, and afterwards
crush it and soak it in water, and the water so coloured becomes the
pigment to be used. The black stain is obtained in the same way as that
used for face-staining. These dyes are put on to the cloth with the
fingers, which the men dip into the dye, or with feathers. In making a
design they do not copy from a pattern placed before them, nor do they
first trace the design on the cloth.</p>

<h3 class="main">Netting.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In dealing with netting, I should begin with the
making of the string; but, as I think the method adopted is not
confined to the mountains, it is perhaps sufficient to refer to my
previous description of thread-making in connection with the
manufacture of leg-bands; though in most netting the strings are
necessarily very much thicker and stronger than are the threads used
for leg-bands, and they are three-stranded.</p>
<p>Hunting and fishing nets are made by men in a simple open form of
netting, worked on the common principle of the reef knot, and having
diamond-shaped holes, with a knot at each corner of each hole. I shall
refer to this form of netting as &ldquo;ordinary network.&rdquo; The
nets are made of thick, strong material, except as regards the hand
fishing nets, which are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5374" href=
"#xd26e5374" name="xd26e5374">204</a>]</span>made of the fine material
used for making leg-bands. These nets are never coloured.</p>
<p>Hammocks are made by men. They are sometimes done entirely with
ordinary network, and are then, I think, similar to Mekeo-made
hammocks; but often only two or three lines of netting are done in this
way, the rest of the net being made in a closer and finer pattern of
interlacing knotless network, which is never adopted on the coast and
Mekeo plains (all nets of this description found there having come down
from the mountains) and which I will call &ldquo;Mafulu
network.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5378src" href="#xd26e5378"
name="xd26e5378src">1</a> I have watched the making of one of these
nets, and will endeavour to describe the process. The ultimate result
of the Mafulu network part of this is shown in <a href="#p081">Plate
81</a>.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Mafulu Net Making (1st Line of Network).</p>
</div>
<p>The maker first formed a base line of three strands of native string
stretched out horizontally. This base line is marked <i>a b</i> in
<a href="#fig08">Fig. 8</a>. He then wound a long length of netting
string round a rough piece of stick to be used as a sort of netting
shuttle. He next worked the netting string on to the base line by a
series of loops or slip-knots as shown in <a href="#fig08">Fig. 8</a>,
strand <i>c</i> of each loop bending upwards and becoming <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5403" href="#xd26e5403" name=
"xd26e5403">205</a>]</span>strand <i>d</i> of the next loop to the
right, and the series of loops extending for the whole length of the
base line, and thus constituting the first loop line of the net. The
hitches of the loops, which appear loose and open in the figure for the
purpose of showing their construction, were really drawn tight on the
base line. On to these loops he then worked one line of ordinary
network, as shown in <a href="#fig09">Fig. 9</a>, the strings <i>a b c
d</i> in this figure being the loops above mentioned, and the knots of
this also being, of course, drawn tight, and not made loose and open,
as shown in the figure. The base of this line again formed a series
made one of these lines of mesh for my instruction; but it is usual in
the making of hammocks to have two or three of them, as appears in the
figure. The next stage commenced the Mafulu network. The form of this
is shown in <a href="#fig10">Fig. 10</a>; and here again the actual
network was more closely drawn than is shown in the illustration,
though it was not drawn tight, as in the case of the ordinary network.
The first line of Mafulu network was worked on to the loops above
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5418" href="#xd26e5418" name=
"xd26e5418">206</a>]</span>it, so as to form a continuous line, in
which many loops of Mafulu work were attached to each loop of the line
of ordinary work above, the former being considerably smaller than the
latter. The rest of the network is similarly made in the Mafulu method,
each loop of each line being connected with a loop of the line above,
until the worker almost reaches the other end of the hammock, which
latter is finished off with ordinary network and a final base line, so
as to correspond with the commencing end. Often there are only four or
five loops of Mafulu network attached to each loop of ordinary network
above them; and I have seen hammocks in which the mesh of the ordinary
network part is much smaller, so that each loop of the bottom line of
this mesh has attached to it only one loop of the top line of Mafulu
mesh; and this last variation is common as regards carrying bags.</p>

<p>The hammocks are never coloured; but they are sometimes decorated
with a few Pandanus or <i>malage</i> seeds hung from their borders.</p>
<p>The different forms of carrying bags have already <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5437" href="#xd26e5437" name=
"xd26e5437">207</a>]</span>been referred to. I will now deal with their
manufacture and colouring. They are made exclusively by women; and the
fibres used in their manufacture are not the same as those employed for
making nets and hammocks. I will deal separately with the five forms
already described by me.</p>
<p>Nos. 1 and 2 are made of either ordinary or Mafulu network, and are
never coloured. When these, or any other bags, are made of Mafulu
network, their elasticity is very great. No. 3 is always made of Mafulu
network, and coloured. No. 4 is made of Mafulu network, and is
sometimes coloured, and sometimes not. No. 5 is made of Mafulu network,
and is sometimes coloured. The string used in making this bag is
different from that used for the others, and is obtained from the bark
of a small shrub.</p>
<p>The question of manufacture introduces another form of bag (<a href=
"#p053">Plate 53, Fig 3</a>), which I may call No. 6. It is used by men
for the purposes of No. 4, and No 5 is also sometimes made in the same
way. The method of manufacture of No. 6 is, I was told, an uncommon
one; and, though I was able to procure one of these bags, I had not an
opportunity of observing the process by which it was made. The
appearance of the bag, however, suggests a process not unlike that of
knitting. Its outer surface displays a series of thick, strong trie
ord-plaited, vertical ridges, all close together, and looking very like
the outside ridges of a knitted woollen stocking; but on the inner
surface these ridges are not to be seen, and the general appearance of
this inside is one of horizontal lines. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5447" href="#xd26e5447" name="xd26e5447">208</a>]</span>The
material of this bag is much closer, thicker and heavier than is that
of any of the others.</p>
<p>The colouring of Nos. 3, 4 and 5 is not put into the netting after
its manufacture, as is done with bark cloth. The string itself is dyed
beforehand, and the lines of colour are worked into the bag in the
process of netting. The colouring is confined to the front of the bag
only, being the part which is visible when the bag is worn hanging over
the back or shoulder. Speaking generally, the colouring is black; but
there is often a little red introduced along with the black. The
pattern is in the general form of parallel horizontal lines or stripes,
which, however, are in places made to recess or turn downwards or
upwards at right angles, and subsequently turn upwards or downwards
again, and then continue horizontally as before, thus giving variety to
the mere design of straight horizontal lines; and these rectangular
breaks are often introduced at more or less symmetrical intervals.
There are other details in these patterns, which can be observed in the
plate. I have one of these bags the lines in which are blue, red and
yellow; but I think this colouring is not usual. The pigments are
obtained from the sources described above with reference to bark
cloth.</p>
<p>The colouring of my specimen of No. 6 bag is also worked into the
bag in the process of knitting, or whatever that process should be
called. But this colouring merely consists of four faint horizontal
lines of pale reddish-brown; and I was told that these bags are
generally uncoloured, or only slightly coloured in thin lines.

<p>The mourning vests worn by chiefs&rsquo; widows are, I believe, made
of Mafulu network; but unfortunately I did not see one of these, and so
cannot describe them.</p>

<h3 class="main">Art, Design, etc.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Art and design among the Mafulu people are only of a
simple and primitive type. There is no carving or other decoration on
their houses, or even on their <i>emone,</i> nor is there any on their
stone or wooden implements. Art and design, other than the arrangement
of feather ornaments, is, in fact, apparently confined to the very
simple designs scratched upon some of their broad abdominal belts,
smoking pipes and lime gourds and perhaps occasionally on one or two
other things, and to the plaited designs displayed in the manufacture
of other abdominal belts and of arm and leg ornaments and plaited
forehead ornaments and feather frames, and to the very simple linear
patterns in which some of their network is made, and the
ground-staining and pattern-colouring of their perineal bands, dancing
aprons and ribbons. As regards the latter, the designs are of a very
simple nature, never apparently representing anything either
realistically or conventionally, and being confined to geometric
designs of straight lines and bands, rectangular and zig-zag patterns
with coloured triangles within the zig-zag patterns, and spots. The
patterns of the perineal bands and dancing ribbons are very simple
indeed; but those of the dancing aprons are more elaborate, covering a
considerable surface of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5464" href=
"#xd26e5464" name="xd26e5464">210</a>]</span>cloth, and often
displaying a fair variety of design on the same apron.</p>
<p>The Mafulu have no visible method of recording events or numbers, or
sending messages, either by marks or notches on sticks, or tying of
knots in string, or any other method, and they are quite unable to
grasp the meaning of a map.</p>
<p>The limited nature of the ideas of artistic design possessed by the
Mafulu people is, I think, a matter for surprise. They are believed to
have Papuan or Papuo-Melanesian blood in their veins. But, even if they
also have another distinct and more primitive ancestry of their own,
not associated with the Papuo-Melanesian types, or even with the pure
Papuan types, found on the coast and in the plains, one would imagine
that contact with these types would have caused the Mafulu people to
learn something of the more advanced art which these other peoples
display and that we should not have to record a sudden drop from
artistic designs embodying curves and natural imitative art to a system
confined to straight lines, zig-zags, and spots. This contact with the
coast and plain people, or at all events with the latter, has certainly
existed for some time back; for, though the mutual fear and antagonism
between coast and mountain natives, which is usually found among savage
peoples, has doubtless existed in this case, and is even now not
altogether eradicated,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5470src" href=
"#xd26e5470" name="xd26e5470src">2</a> direct or indirect trading
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5473" href="#xd26e5473" name=
"xd26e5473">211</a>]</span>relationship, including in particular the
interchange of the stone implements and feathers of the mountains for
the shell decorations of the coast, is not a mere recent development of
the last few years only. It seems to me that the existence of this
decorative hiatus points to a rather small inherent sense of design in
the Mafulu mind. It may be, however, that the absence of imitative art,
to which I have already referred in connection with totemism and clan
badges, is partly due to the absence of totemism and of the imitative
stimulus, which, as Dr. Haddon has more than once pointed out,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5475src" href="#xd26e5475" name="xd26e5475src">3</a>
arises from it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5484" href=

<h3 class="main">Music and Singing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Mafulu people are naturally musical and have good
musical ears&mdash;much more so than is the case in Mekeo and on the
coast, thus conforming to what I believe to be a general rule that
music is usually more indigenous in hill country than it is in the
plains. Their instruments are the drum, the jew&rsquo;s-harp and a
small flute; but the flute is not a true Mafulu instrument, and has
probably been acquired from Mekeo.</p>
<p>The drum (<a href="#p075">Plate 75, Fig. 3</a>) is like the Mekeo
drum, but smaller, and its open end is cut in deep indentations. The
wooden body of the drum is made from various trees. A pine tree is the
favourite one; but others are used, including a tree the native name of
which is <i>arive</i>, which word is also the native word for a drum.
The membrane is made of the skin of a reptile, probably the
&ldquo;iguana.&rdquo; The maker of a drum must climb up the tree from
the wood of which he is about to make it, and there, until the drum is
finished, he must remain sitting among the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5501" href="#xd26e5501" name=
"xd26e5501">213</a>]</span>branches, or, if these are inconvenient for
the purpose, he may erect a scaffold around the trunk of the tree, with
a platform on the top of it, and work upon that. Whilst working, he
must always keep the upper or tympanic end of his drum facing the wind,
the idea of this being that the wind gets into the drum, and makes it
musical. His food is brought to him, whilst in his tree, by some woman,
probably his mother if he is a bachelor, or his wife if he is married,
and he lets down a string by which he hauls it up; but he is under no
special restriction as to the food he may eat. There is no
superstition, such as is found among the Roro and Mekeo people,
compelling him, in the event of his seeing a woman during the making of
the drum, to throw it away and begin a new one.</p>
<p>The jew&rsquo;s-harp (<a href="#p020">Plate 20, Fig. 2</a>), though
seen in Mekeo, is, I was told, as regards its manufacture, an
instrument of the mountains. It is made out of bamboo or palm, or some
other tree having a hollow or soft interior, from which is cut a piece
about 8 or 10 inches long. A portion of this piece is cut away
longitudinally, leaving for the making of the instrument only
two-thirds or half, or even one-third, of the convex outside stem
circumference on one side and the flat surface of the cut-away part on
the other, and the latter is then hollowed out, leaving, however, a
solid head an inch or two long at one end. The hollow piece thus
produced is cut into three longitudinal sections or strips, of which
the two outside ones are longer than the central one. The two outside
strips are left at their full width from the head downwards to a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5508" href="#xd26e5508" name=
"xd26e5508">214</a>]</span>distance of 2 or 3 inches from the other
end, from which point they are cut away, very much as one would cut
away the divided nib of a quill pen, so that the actual tips of these
two strips are quite slender, being no broader than their thickness.
These two ends are tied together with fine vegetable fibre. The centre
strip, which is generally narrower than the other two at its
commencement by the head, is further reduced in width by a more
immediate and gradual process of paring down, and so becomes a very
slender vibrating tongue or reed, the tip of which goes almost up to,
but does not quite reach, the point at which the tips of the two outer
strips are bound together. A hole is bored through the solid head; and
through this hole is passed a thick string of native make from 5 to 10
or 12 inches long, secured at one end by a knot on the flat side of the
head, to keep the string from slipping out, and having at the other end
a large, rough, ornamental tassel. The tassel is generally in part
composed of the untwisted fibres of the string itself; but to these is
added something else, such as a bunch of feathers, or two smaller
bunches of feathers; and among these may be seen such miscellaneous
articles as a fragment of dried-up fruit, or a part of the backbone of
a fish. For playing the instrument, they place its tail end, with the
hollow side inwards, to the mouth, holding the extreme tip of that end
in the fingers of the left hand, and keep the tongue of the instrument
in a constant state of vibration, by smart, rapid, jerky pullings of
the tasselled string.</p>
<p>The flute is merely a small simple instrument made <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5512" href="#xd26e5512" name=
"xd26e5512">215</a>]</span>out of a small bamboo stem, with one or two
holes bored in it.</p>
<p>All these instruments are played by both men and women; but the
jew&rsquo;s-harp and flute are regarded only as toys.</p>
<p>I believe the Mafulu people occasionally sing at dances to the
beating of the drums; but this is quite unusual; and they never sing to
the music of the jew&rsquo;s-harp or flute. Both men and women sing,
generally several or many together, not so often alone. Their songs are
all very simple, and are chiefly sung in unison or octaves. I was told
that they sometimes accomplish simple harmonies, the notes of which may
simultaneously rise or fall either with the same or different
intervals, or may rise and fall in contrary motion; or the harmony may
be produced by one man or part of the group sustaining a note, whilst
another changes it; and I myself heard an example of the latter of
these, and also heard singing in which, while a group of men were
singing the same simple air, some of them were occasionally singing one
part of it, whilst the others seemed to be singing another part, thus
producing a very simple catch or canon. I am not, however, quite
certain as to this. Their songs are both cheerful and plaintive; but
the latter predominate, and are mainly in the minor key. The subjects
of their songs are generally sentimental love, and include ditties by
young men about their sweethearts; and I believe that some of their
songs are indecent, though I am not sure of this. They <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5518" href="#xd26e5518" name=
"xd26e5518">216</a>]</span>also have warlike songs; and, when a special
event occurs, songs are often composed with reference to it. For
example, not long ago a chief was taken by the authorities to Port
Moresby, and died there; and songs about this were sung all through his
district. Anyone will compose a topical song; in fact, a man will begin
singing one in the <i lang="xx">emone,</i> making it up as he goes on,
and the others will join. The men have a very pretty custom of singing
together very softly when at the end of the day they have retired to
their <i lang="xx">emone,</i> and have lain down to sleep, the singing
being very gentle, and producing what I can only describe as a sort of
crooning sound, like a lullaby or cradle song. I once heard one of
these songs sung by my carriers the last thing at night as they lay
beneath the floor of the building in which I was sleeping; and the
effect was absolutely charming.</p>
<p>As an example of Mafulu music I give the following, which, though
not, I fear, quite accurate, is I think a substantially correct version
of the music of a war song sung by the Mambule and Sivu communities in
connection with joint hostilities by them against another community,
and I have so far as possible added the song itself.</p>
<div class="figure music1width"><img src="images/music1.gif" alt=

<p class="first">1st Verse: <span lang="xx">E! e! e! Si-vu Mambule juju

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5543" href="#xd26e5543" name=

<p>It will be observed that the first line is whistling only. I was
informed that it is a common practice to whistle the air before singing
the first verse; though I did not gather that it was always done. It
will also be noticed that simple harmonies occur in the fourth and
fifth bars. I cannot say whether the two parts in the music are
sustained or taken up by the voices upon any defined scheme, and, if
so, what that scheme is. Nor can I say whether the voices which take
the lower notes in the music are silent after the word <i>la,</i> or
repeat that word in the sixth bar, with or without the upper voices, in
order to bring the tune to a full close. I have only given two verses;
and, as regards the song in question, I doubt if there were any more.
Unfortunately I am unable to translate the words, and can only give the
meanings of the following:&mdash;</p>
<p><i>E! e! e!</i> are merely meaningless exclamatory sounds, such as
we have in civilised songs. <i lang="xx">Sivu</i> is the name of a
Fuyuge community close to the Mission Station, being, in fact, the one
referred to by me in my chapter on communities. <i lang=
"xx">Mambule</i> is the name of another of these communities, further
away from the station, being, as stated in my introductory chapter, the
name of the community from which the name Mafulu arises. I cannot give
verbal explanations of any of the other words; but I may say that a
rough translation of the second verse is &ldquo;My village, your
village is alike (or equal.)&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Dancing.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Mafulu people, like other New Guinea natives, are
fond of dancing, and indulge in it extensively, especially in
connection with feasts and ceremonies.</p>
<p>Their dancing is of an exceedingly active and lively character. The
movements of the feet are lively and jumping, often half a hop and half
a run; and, whilst dancing, their heads are actively moving backwards
and forwards and to both sides. The general progressive movement of a
dancing party is slow, but not a crawl; and the progress along the
village enclosure is usually accomplished by a series of diagonal
advances, by which they zig-zag backwards and forwards across the
enclosure, and in this way gradually travel along it. Very often the
dancers divide themselves into two parties, which in their zig-zag
progress alternately approach and recede from each other. The dancers
are always facing in the direction in which at that moment they are
moving. Men and women never dance together, except at the big feast,
where they do so in the way already described.</p>
<p>This method of dancing is in striking contrast to that of the Mekeo
people, whose movements are generally very gentle and slow, those of
the feet, which are accompanied by a corresponding genuflexion,
downwards and outwards, being a slow slight step, usually barely more
than a shuffle, the feet being hardly lifted off the ground, and those
of the head being confined to a slow and sedate backwards and forwards
nodding. Also the progress of a party of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5569" href="#xd26e5569" name="xd26e5569">219</a>]</span>Mekeo
dancers is generally very slow,&mdash;a crawl,&mdash;so much so as
often to be barely perceptible, perhaps two or three inches being
accomplished at each step, and the line of progress of a dancing party
is usually a straight line down the village enclosure; and more
commonly, though not always, the position of each dancer is sideways to
the then actual direction of progression. And in Mekeo women and men
often dance together in one group.</p>
<p>Another difference between Mafulu and Mekeo dancing is that among
the Mafulu, though the drum-beating and dancing go on simultaneously,
the singing, in which all the dancers and non-dancers of both sexes
join, does not usually take place during the actual dancing, but only
during periodic pauses, in which the drum-beating and dancing cease;
whereas in Mekeo the drum-beating, dancing and singing all go on
continuously and simultaneously. As regards these Mafulu pauses in the
dancing, I should explain that these are quite distinct from the
resting pauses (in which there is neither drum-beating, dancing, nor
singing) which are customary both among the Mafulu and the Mekeo
people.</p>
<p>A further difference arises as regards the dancing decorations. Both
Mafulu and Mekeo natives have elaborate high framework head feather
decorations, which are worn by some, but not necessarily all, of the
dancers; and they are much ornamented about their bodies. But the
Mafulu people generally wear their finest and most beautiful feathers
on their backs, whereas among the Mekeo natives the head ornament
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5575" href="#xd26e5575" name=
"xd26e5575">220</a>]</span>is the chief feature of the decoration; and
in Mekeo any man who has not a framework head decoration generally has
sticking in his hair a tall, upright feather, which sways slowly
backwards and forwards in response to the slow nodding movements of his
head.</p>
<p>The special dancing ornaments worn by the Mafulu are the aprons worn
by women, the ribbons worn by men and women, the forehead ornaments
worn by men, the long shell nose ornaments worn by both, and the huge
head feather erections. But for dances the people generally wear all
the decorative finery they possess or are able to borrow; and they
usually with special care paint their faces in various colours, and
their bodies red.</p>
<p>The comparison above given between the dancing of the Mafulu people
and that of the people of Mekeo brings me to a suggestion, made to me
by Father Clauser, that the Mafulu mode of dancing had its origin in an
imitation of that of the red bird of paradise, and the Mekeo mode in an
imitation of that of the goura pigeon. In support of this suggestion he
gave me the following information concerning the dancing of these
birds, which may be compared with the description given above of the
dancing of the Mafulu and Mekeo natives respectively:&mdash;</p>
<p>The movements of the red birds of paradise, when dancing, are
remarkably lively, the birds hopping and jumping about the tree
branches and from branch to branch, and bobbing their heads backwards
and forwards and from side to side, almost as though they had gone mad.
The progression along the branches is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5583" href="#xd26e5583" name="xd26e5583">221</a>]</span>fairly
rapid; but there is not apparently any continuous line of progression
in any given direction, and the birds seem to have a curious way of
approaching and receding from each other as they do so. The birds
always face in the direction in which they are at the time moving, and
do not dance sideways. Moreover, the dance is an alternation of wild
dancing and intermittent pauses; and during the dancing both the males
and females are silent, but during the pauses they are uttering their
songs or cries.</p>
<p>The dancing movements of the goura pigeons are a gentle slow
shuffle, and are accompanied by a slow bowing or nodding of the head.
The progressive movement is exceedingly slow, and is always a
continuous one in the same direction, and it is usually a sideways
movement. The dancing and accompanying cooing of the pigeons go on
continuously and simultaneously, and the rhythm of the latter is
curiously like the more usual rhythm of the Mekeo drums.</p>
<p>I have unfortunately never had opportunities of observing the
dancing of either of these birds, and so cannot personally vouch for
the correctness of the above descriptions of them. But Father Clauser
has often watched them, and he is undoubtedly a careful observer, upon
whose testimony we may rely; and I may add that my efforts since my
return to England to obtain evidence, confirmatory or otherwise, of
these descriptions have produced confirmation of some of the facts
stated, and have not produced any contradictions.</p>
<p>Then again attention must be drawn to the fact <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5592" href="#xd26e5592" name=
"xd26e5592">222</a>]</span>that the magnificent feather decoration of
the bird of paradise is mainly upon or springing from its back or body,
whilst the goura pigeon&rsquo;s sole projecting decoration, and perhaps
its chief beauty, is the crest upon its head, to which the Mekeo single
upright head feather may be likened.</p>
<p>My efforts to obtain light from native sources upon this question of
imitation in Mafulu were fruitless, as the natives questioned knew
nothing of it; and on my return from Mafulu to the coast I did not
again pass through the Mekeo villages. But on reaching the coast I made
further enquiries upon the subject from the Fathers there of the
Mission, and obtained three interesting pieces of information. First, I
was told that the Mekeo clan Inawae of the Mekeo village Oriropetana,
whose clan badge is the goura pigeon, and who are not allowed to kill
and eat it, and whose bird totem it appears to be, say that they are
descended from the goura pigeon, and that an ancestor of theirs, though
himself a man, had all the powers and faculties of movement of those
birds, and that he used to dance with them, and so learnt the dance and
taught it to his people. Unfortunately no enquiry had been made as to
the question of any imitative character in their present dancing, and
the information only emanated from a particular clan with a particular
association with the bird. I therefore do not attach undue general
importance to this case.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5596src" href=
"#xd26e5596" name="xd26e5596src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5607" href="#xd26e5607" name="xd26e5607">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>Secondly, I was told that the Pokau people, whose dance is
practically the same as that of the Mekeo people, themselves say that
their dancing is an imitation of that of the goura pigeon. This
certainly tends to support Father Clauser&rsquo;s suggestion as regards
Mekeo. Thirdly, some natives of Kuni, who are undoubtedly very similar
and closely related to the Mafulu, and whose dancing is very similar to
that of the latter, were questioned on the subject in my presence, and
under my direction. The question put was, &ldquo;When Kuni people are
dancing, are they in their dance imitating anything, and if so
what?&rdquo; (no mention or suggestion being made of a bird or of
anything else). The answer was that they were imitating the dance of
the <i>goloala</i>, which I was told was not the red bird of paradise,
but was another small species of that bird with a yellowish-white body,
yellow head and yellowish-white wings. The leading question was then
put to them, whether they were sure the bird was the yellow one
described by them, and not the red one; which question was answered
definitely in the affirmative. And subsequently, when, in order to test
their definiteness and certainty in what they had told me, I showed
them a few postcard pictures of birds of paradise, which included the
red one and others, but not one such as is above described, and almost
invited them to recognise one of these as being the bird they meant,
they were firm in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5613" href=
"#xd26e5613" name="xd26e5613">224</a>]</span>their insistence that the
bird to which they referred was not shown in any of the pictures. This,
I think, helps to support Father Clauser&rsquo;s suggestion as regards
the Mafulu, subject of course to the question of the variety of bird of
paradise which is imitated.</p>
<p>Dealing with this question of imitation as a whole, and taking into
consideration the apparently marked similarities between the dancing of
the two tribes of natives and the two genera of birds, and the further
element, perhaps not so strong, as to the similarities in distribution
upon the bodies of their decorations, and bearing in mind the evidence
obtained from native sources, which, though obviously only fragmentary
and insufficient in character, is so far as it goes distinctly
confirmatory, I am impelled to suggest that Father Clauser&rsquo;s
theory is not without foundation, and indeed amounts, subject to the
question of the species of bird of paradise, to a very substantial
possibility. And it is undoubtedly an interesting one.<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Mafulu children have neither dolls nor other toys,
and do not make cat&rsquo;s-cradles. The young boys amuse themselves
with small bows and arrows and spears, which they make themselves. One
common sport is for the boys, armed with their spears, to stand in a
row and for another boy to roll in front of them a ball, made out of
the root of a banana tree, with its many rootlets intertwined, and for
the boys to try to hit it with their spears as it passes them. A
similar game is played in Mekeo and on the coast; but there the ball is
often made out of the outer fibre of a cocoanut. Small boys and girls
amuse themselves with glissading down the steep grassy slopes. There is
also a sort of fighting game for boys, in which young men sometimes
join. A number of them divide themselves into two opposing groups, all
armed with little darts, made of reeds on which a few leaves are left
at the head ends; and these two groups mutually attack each other,
advancing and retreating, according <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5640" href="#xd26e5640" name="xd26e5640">226</a>]</span>to the
fortunes of the fight. Boys, and men also, play at tug-of-war, using
long canes for ropes; and boys and girls have swings, constructed
either by looping two flexible rope-like tree stems together at the
bottom, or with a single rope, with a loop at the bottom, in which to
place their feet. But there are no racing or jumping or gymnastic
games, and no group or singing children&rsquo;s games. <span class=

Macgregor, in describing (<i>Ann. Rep.</i>, June, 1890, p. 47) the
movements and actions of the Kiwai (Fly river mouth) natives prior to a
canoe attack by them upon him, says: &ldquo;The canoes darted hither
and thither, as if performing a circus dance or a Highland reel, and
all these movements were accompanied by the chant of a paean that
sounded as if composed to imitate the cooing&mdash;soft, plaintive, and
melodious&mdash;of the pigeons of their native forests&rdquo;; and he
refers to the performance as a &ldquo;canoe choral dance.&rdquo; It
was, of course, not a dance in the sense in which I am dealing with the
subject here; but the apparently imitative character of the singing is
perhaps worth noticing in connection with this dancing question. See
also the description (<i>Country Life</i>, March 4, 1911) by Mr. Walter
Goodfellow, the leader of the recent expedition into Dutch New Guinea,
of the dancing and accompanying singing of the Mimika natives whom he
met there, and his suggestion that the final calls of these songs were
derived from that of the greater paradise bird. Mr. Goodfellow has
since told me with reference to these Mimika songs that he was forcibly
struck by the resemblance of the termination of <i>most</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5628" href="#xd26e5628" name=
"xd26e5628">225</a>]</span>of the songs to the common cry of the
greater bird of paradise, and said: &ldquo;They finished with the same
abrupt note, repeated three times (like the birds).&rdquo; Dr. Haddon
has been good enough to lend me the manuscript of his notes on the
dances performed in the islands of Torres Straits, which will probably
have appeared in Vol. IV. of the <i>Reports of the Cambridge
Anthropological Expedition to Torres Straits</i> before this book is
published. Here again I find interesting records of imitative dancing.
One dance imitates the swimming movements of the large lizard
(Varanus), another is an imitation of the movements of a crab, another
imitates those of a pigeon, and another those of a pelican. At a dance
which I witnessed in the Roro village of Seria a party from Delena
danced the &ldquo;Cassowary&rdquo; dance; and Father Egedi says it is
certainly so called because its movements are in some way an imitation
of those of the cassowary.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

is really <i lang="xx">gegedove</i>; but it is shortened to <i lang=

&ldquo;u.&rdquo; There are two words for &ldquo;and,&rdquo; namely
<i lang="xx">ta</i> and <i lang="xx">une</i>. The &ldquo;u&rdquo; here
is the <i lang="xx">une</i> shortened, and put instead of <i lang=

<p>20 = <i lang="xx">Bodo gegedo ta jovari gegedo</i> (two hands and
two feet).</p>
<p>As regards these numerals it will be seen that in some cases
alternatives are given, whilst in other cases, where corresponding
alternatives would appear to be equally applicable, they are not given;
the reason is that in these latter cases the alternatives do not in
fact appear to be used.</p>
<p>There is no numerical phraseology to indicate any number above
twenty; and in the ordinary affairs of life, although numeration can be
carried in this cumbrous way up to twenty, they rarely use the numerals
beyond ten, and anything over that will be referred to as <i lang=
"xx">tale, tale, tale, tale</i> (which may be translated &ldquo;plenty,
plenty, plenty, plenty&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Important counting, such as that of pigs at a feast, is accomplished
by the actual use of the hands and feet. The fingers stretched open
mean nothing; Closing down the thumb of the right hand indicates one;
closing down also the first finger of that hand indicates two; and so
on with the other fingers of the right hand, till you reach the closing
down of the thumb and all the fingers of the right hand, which
indicates five. Then, keeping all the right hand closed, they begin
with the left hand also. Closing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5810" href="#xd26e5810" name="xd26e5810">230</a>]</span>down only
the thumb indicates six; and so on as before, until the thumbs and all
the fingers of both hands are closed, which indicates ten.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5812src" href="#xd26e5812" name=
"xd26e5812src">2</a></p>
<p>Then they go to the feet. They keep both hands closed and together,
and with the right fist they point to the toes, beginning with the big
toe of the right foot, and so along the other toes of that foot, and
then go to the big toe of the left foot, and so along the other toes of
that foot, thus reaching the enumerative total of twenty. They do not,
when wishing to indicate a number, simply place their fingers and hands
and feet simultaneously in the requisite position for doing so. They
always go through the whole process of finger and toe counting from the
beginning. For example, to indicate eight, they turn in the thumb and
all the fingers of the right hand, and afterwards the thumb and two
fingers of the left hand, separately, and one alter another, until the
right position is reached; and similarly as regards numbers over ten,
they solemnly turn down all the fingers one after another, and then
point to the toes one after another, until they get to the right one
for indicating the desired number. When the fingers and toes of the
person counting are exhausted, he has recourse to those of another
person, if he wishes to count further, although he has then passed the
limit of numerical phraseology. For the purpose of counting big numbers
they are always sitting, and as in counting they exhaust hands and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5817" href="#xd26e5817" name=
"xd26e5817">231</a>]</span>feet, the latter are put together, If, for
example, they reach eighty, there are four men sitting, with all their
hands and feet crowded together; and if the number be eighty-three,
there is also a fifth man with a thumb and two fingers of his right
hand closed up. Sometimes a number above ten, but not over twenty, is
indicated with the hands only by counting up to ten in the ordinary
way, and then opening all the fingers and counting again, until they
reach the requisite amount in excess of ten.</p>
<p>I do not think it can be said that these people have in their minds
any real abstract idea of number, at all events beyond twenty. Each
finger turned down and toe pointed to, in succession, seems to
represent to their minds the article (<i>e.g.</i>, a pig) which is
counted, rather than a step in a process of mental addition. But this
is a matter upon which I can only express myself in a very general way;
and indeed the mental stage at which the mere physical idea of the
objects counted has developed into the abstract idea of numbers would
in any case be exceedingly difficult to ascertain, or even, perhaps, to
define.</p>
<p>They never use pebbles or sticks or anything else of that kind, and
have no method of recording numbers or anything else by notching
sticks; and they have no weights or measures.</p>

<h3 class="main">Currency and Trade.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Mafulu people have no currency in the true sense,
every transaction being one of exchange; but nevertheless some specific
articles, especially some of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5831"
href="#xd26e5831" name="xd26e5831">232</a>]</span>the dearer ones, can
only be acquired by the offering of certain other specific articles,
and certain things have definite recognised relative values for the
purpose of exchange.</p>
<p>As examples of the former of these statements, I may say that a pig
used to be always paid for in dogs&rsquo; teeth&mdash;though this
practice is not now, I think, so strict&mdash;and that some of their
finer head feather dancing ornaments and ornamental nose pieces can
still only be paid for in dogs&rsquo; teeth; also that there is a
special kind of feather ornament, composed of many small feathers fixed
in a line on a string, which can only be obtained in exchange for a
particular sort of shell necklace.</p>
<p>As examples of recognised relative values, I may state that the
proper payment in dogs&rsquo; teeth for a pig is a chain of dogs&rsquo;
teeth equal in length to the body of the pig, the latter being measured
from the tip of its nose to the base of its tail; and that the payment
for the special feather ornament is its own length of the corresponding
shell necklace.</p>
<p>Exchange and barter is generally only engaged in between members of
different communities, and not between those of the same community. An
apparent exception to this arises in the purchase of pigs at certain
ceremonies above referred to; but in this case it is really a matter of
ceremony, and not one of ordinary barter. There are no regular markets,
such as exist in some other parts of the country, the exchange of goods
being effected by one or more individuals going with their articles of
exchange to some other community, where they hope to get what
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5839" href="#xd26e5839" name=
"xd26e5839">233</a>]</span>they require. The nearest approach to a
market arises intermittently when there is to be a big feast. Then the
communities giving, and invited to, the feast require a large supply of
ornaments, especially for those who are going to dance, and probably do
not possess a sufficient quantity. They therefore have to procure these
ornaments elsewhere; and the natural place to go to is some other
community, possibly a long way off, which has recently been in the same
want of extensive ornaments for a feast, and has procured and used
them, and now has them, so to speak, in stock, and will be glad to
dispose of them again. Thus ornaments used for feasts are sold and
resold and travel about the country very extensively. <span class=

the Western Papuans, who, according to Dr. Seligmann, also have only
two numerals, but who are apparently not able to count to anything like
the extent which can be done by the Mafulu (<i>Melanesians of British
New Guinea</i>, p. 4). According to Mr. Monckton the Kambisi (Chirima
valley) people only count on their fingers and up to ten, not on their
toes and up to twenty (<i>Annual Report</i>, June, 1906, p. 89). Father

<p class="first">I have been fortunate in having had some interesting
and valuable linguistic material placed at my disposal for publication
by Father Egedi and in having had further material added to it by Dr.
Seligmann and Mr. Sidney H. Ray. I have thought it better to deal with
it in five appendices, and I am greatly indebted to Mr. Ray for having
undertaken the laborious task of their compilation. I give the
following explanation concerning these appendices.</p>
<p>(1) Is a grammar of the Fuyuge language. The original manuscript is
the work of Father Egedi, the, materials from which it was prepared by
him having been collected in the Mafulu villages. The appendix is
Father Egedi&rsquo;s Grammar, translated and edited by Mr. Ray.</p>
<p>(2) Is a short note on the Afoa language prepared by Dr. W.&nbsp;M.
Strong, when he was Government Agent in Mekeo, and handed by him to Dr.
Seligmann for publication. To this note Mr. Ray has added a
footnote.</p>
<p>(3) Is a note on the Kovio language prepared by Dr. Strong, and
handed by him to Dr. Seligmann. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e5853" href="#xd26e5853" name="xd26e5853">235</a>]</span>This note
refers to the languages spoken in the neighbourhoods of Inavarene and
the Inava valley and of the Upper Lakekamu river, all of which were
found by Dr. Strong to be somewhat similar. The footnote is by Mr.
Ray.</p>
<p>(4) Is a comparative vocabulary, prepared by Mr. Ray, of the
languages of some of the different Papuan-speaking people of the
mountain districts of Central British New Guinea. The words in the
&ldquo;Mafulu&rdquo; column are taken from a very lengthy MS.
vocabulary compiled by Father Egedi in Mafulu. Those in the
&ldquo;Kambisa&rdquo; column were all collected by the Rev. P.&nbsp;J.
Money in the Kambisa villages of the Upper Chirima valley during Mr.
Monckton&rsquo;s expedition, referred to in my introductory chapter.
Most of these words are taken from the New Guinea <i>Annual Report</i>
for 1905&ndash;6; but to them have been added other words, which had
been collected by Mr. Money. The words in the &ldquo;Korona&rdquo;
column are taken from an MS. vocabulary prepared by Dr. Strong at
Korona, also mentioned in my introductory chapter, and handed by him to
Dr. Seligmann. Those in the &ldquo;Afoa&rdquo; column are taken from an
MS. vocabulary prepared by Dr. Strong in connection with his Afoa
notes, to which are added in square brackets some other words taken
from Father Egedi&rsquo;s vocabulary in <i>Anthropos</i> II., 1907, pp.
1016&ndash;1021, this vocabulary being there called by him Tauata. The
words in the &ldquo;Kovio&rdquo; column are taken from an MS.
vocabulary prepared by Dr. Strong in connection with his Kovio notes,
to which are added in square brackets some &ldquo;Oru-Lopiku&rdquo;
words <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5863" href="#xd26e5863" name=
"xd26e5863">236</a>]</span>collected by Father Egedi, and published in
<i>Anthropos</i> II., 1907, pp. 1016&ndash;1021. As regards this column
I must explain that Dr. Strong&rsquo;s words were all collected within
the districts to which his notes refer, but that Father Egedi&rsquo;s
words, though in part collected there, were, I believe, in part
collected further to the east.</p>
<p>(5) Is a series of notes by Mr. Ray upon the matter contained in the
previous appendices.</p>
<p>I am perhaps open to criticism for introducing into a book of my own
notes on the Mafulu people such extensive material written by others,
and relating to other mountain districts as well as to that of the
Mafulu; but my belief as to the probable similarity in many respects
between the Papuan-speaking natives of these central mountain
districts, and the obvious value and importance of the matter which has
been so kindly placed at my disposal, justify me, I think, in
introducing it; and indeed I should be doing but ill service to New
Guinea ethnology if I did not take advantage of these opportunities
which have been offered to me.</p>
<p>Though I am not qualified to discuss these materials from the
grammatical and scientific linguistic point of view, there are a few
matters to which I should like to draw attention, as affecting
statements appearing in this book, and which were written by me before
I received this linguistic material.</p>
<p>Regarding the question raised in my introductory chapter as to the
extension of the Fuyuge linguistic area so far south as Korona, it will
be noticed that a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5876" href=
"#xd26e5876" name="xd26e5876">237</a>]</span>large number of the words
in the Mafulu and Korona columns are the same, or very similar. Dr.
Strong, in some unpublished MS. notes in Dr. Seligmann&rsquo;s
possession, to which I have had access, says as regards the Mafulu and
Korona languages that &ldquo;there is nothing to show that the two
languages may not be for all practical purposes identical,&rdquo; and
Mr. Ray in his concluding notes classes Mafulu and Korona together as
dialects of Fuyuge. The village of Sikube, mentioned by Mr. Ray, is, I
believe, on the Upper Vanapa river and north of Mt. Lilley, and so is
well within the Fuyuge-speaking area as defined by the Fathers.</p>
<p>Concerning the Kambisa (Upper Chirima valley) column, the similarity
of many of the words contained in it to those in either the Mafulu or
the Korona column is obvious; and it is curious that some of these
words appear to resemble the Korona words more than they do those of
Mafulu. I also think I may say that the similarity between Kambisa
words on the one hand, and those of either Mafulu or Korona on the
other, is almost equal to the similarity between Mafulu and Korona; and
Mr. Ray classes Kambisa along with Mafulu and Korona as dialects of
Fuyuge. So the statement in the introductory chapter that the valley of
the Upper Chirima river is included in the Fuyuge area has, I think,
stood the test of some detailed linguistic comparison.</p>
<p>The note by Dr. Strong upon what he calls the Kovio language and his
Kovio vocabulary both relate to a district which is within the
Fathers&rsquo; Oru-Lopiku <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5883"
href="#xd26e5883" name="xd26e5883">238</a>]</span>linguistic area; and
I venture to repeat the suggestion, made in my introductory chapter,
that for the present should adopt the term Kovio for the two areas
which the Fathers call Oru-Lopiku and Boboi, though eventually we may
be able to distinguish between these two areas.</p>
<p>The Afoa or Tauata area is the Fathers&rsquo; Ambo area. The Afoa
column discloses a very few words which resemble the Fuyuge words; but
it seems obvious that the Afoa language does not belong to the Fuyuge
group, and this is the view taken of it by Mr. Ray.</p>
<p>There are two matters in Mr. Ray&rsquo;s classification in the fifth
appendix which I wish to mention. It seems to have been already assumed
that the Rev. James Chalmers&rsquo; Kabana language could not have been
collected on Mt. Victoria; and I would point out that this mountain is
quite outside what now appears to be the Fuyuge area. As regards the
Afoa language the references by Dr. Strong to Mt. Pizoko and Mt.
Davidson bring me back to my observations upon the point in my
introductory chapter. If the Fathers are right in putting Mt. Pizoko
within the Fuyuge area, it is hardly correct to say (see introductory
chapter) that the Afoa language is spoken in the villages on Mt.
Pizoko; but it might well be, as quoted by Mr. Ray, that a Fuyuge
native in a Mt. Pizoko village spoke Afoa fluently, as this mountain is
close to the Fathers&rsquo; Fuyuge-Afoa boundary. Also Mt. Davidson is
according to the Fathers in the Boboi area; but Dr. Strong seems to
have regarded it as Ambo, and to have treated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5889" href="#xd26e5889" name=
"xd26e5889">239</a>]</span>vocabulary matter collected from a native
who came from a village &ldquo;apparently on the slopes of&rdquo; that
mountain as having been taken from an Ambo native. In this case,
however, there seems to be some doubt as to where this native did in
fact come from; and the eastern slopes of Mt. Davidson are not far from
the Fathers&rsquo; Afoa boundary.</p>
<p>I think that these linguistic materials, taken as a whole, are, so
far as they go, well in accord with the delimitation by the Fathers of
the Fuyuge area, except as regards their view concerning Korona, as to
which they did not profess actual knowledge, and merely expressed a
doubt, and subject to the point that, for linguistic purposes at all
events, the Fathers&rsquo; use of the word &ldquo;Mafulu&rdquo; as
representing the whole Fuyuge area is perhaps not desirable, and would
be better replaced by the term &ldquo;Fuyuge,&rdquo; with subdivisions
of &ldquo;Mafulu,&rdquo; &ldquo;Korona,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Kambisa,&rdquo; as given by Mr. Ray; though probably Sikube
might be included in either Mafulu or Korona, as geographically it is
evidently between these two. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5893"

<h3 class="main">Ailments and Remedies.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All serious ailments occurring up to certain ages, and
except in certain cases, are generally assumed to be the work of
someone acting in connection with a spirit; but, speaking generally, no
efforts appear to be made by imprecation or other supernatural method
to propitiate or contend against these spirits, except by the use of
general charms against illness, and except, so far as the propitiation
or driving out of the spirit is involved, by one or other of the
specific remedies for specific ailments mentioned below. The natives
have, however, for common diseases cures of which some are obviously
purely fanciful and superstitious, but some are probably more or less
practical.</p>
<p>The chief ailments are colds and complications arising from them,
malaria, dysentery, stomach and bowel and similar complaints, toothache
and wounds.</p>
<p>Dysentery has recognised and accredited curers, both men and women.
The operator chews and crushes with his teeth the root of a vegetable
(I do not know what it is) which they grow in their gardens, and then
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5906" href="#xd26e5906" name=
"xd26e5906">241</a>]</span>wraps it up into a small bundle in a bunch
of grass, and gives it to the patient to suck. This remedy does not
appear to be effective.</p>
<p>There are men who are specially skilled in dealing with stomach and
bowel troubles. The operator takes in his hand a stone, and with the
other hand he sprinkles that stone over with ashes. He then makes over
it an incantation, in which, though his lips are seen to be moving, no
sound comes out of them; after which he takes some of the ashes from
the stone, which he still holds in his hand, and with these ashes he
rubs the stomach of the patient, who, I was told, generally at once
feels rather better, or says so.</p>
<p>There are also women who deal with cases believed to be caused by
the presence in the stomach of a snake, which has to be got out. Here
the operator takes a piece of bark cloth, with which she rubs the front
of the patient&rsquo;s body, but without any incantation. Then, as she
removes the cloth from the body, she makes a movement as though she
were wrapping up in it something, presumably the escaped snake; and
afterwards she carries the cloth away with her, and the cure is thus
effected.</p>
<p>A man with toothache will say that &ldquo;a spirit is eating my
teeth.&rdquo; The people seem to have a knowledge of something inside
the teeth, the nature of which I am not able to state definitely, but
which apparently is, in fact, the nerve, and they recognise that it is
in this something that the pain arises; but I could not ascertain the
connection between this something and the spirit which is supposed to
cause the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5914" href="#xd26e5914"
name="xd26e5914">242</a>]</span>trouble. If the aching tooth can be got
at, they adopt a method the native explanation of which was translated
to me as being a drawing or driving out of the mysterious something
from the tooth. This is done in some way with an ordinary native comb,
without extracting the tooth itself; but how it is done I could not
ascertain. There is no incantation connected with the operation.
Another cure is for the patient to chew the leaf of a certain tree (I
do not know what tree), so that the sap of it gets into the hole in the
tooth, and thereby, as they think, draws or drives out this nerve, or
whatever the something may be. The Fathers of the Mission told me that
both these two remedies do really appear to be effective.</p>
<p>Wounds are the speciality of many healers with special knowledge of
the curative properties of various plants, and who gather the plant,
make an incantation over it, boil it in water, and then with that water
wash the wound. There are also men who operate surgically on wounds
with knives made of stone or shell or bamboo.</p>
<p>Charms, probably of a poisonous nature, are used generally for the
warding off of sickness, these being carried in the little charm
bags.</p>
<p>A general and universal cure for all ailments is a piece of bark,
tied with a piece of string to the neck or head, all neck ornaments
having been first removed.</p>
<p>I regret that as regards all these matters I am only able to
indicate shortly and generally the methods of cure, and can give no
further explanation concerning them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Death and Burial.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>(Ordinary People.)</i></p>
<p>When a man or woman is regarded as dying, he or she is at once
attended by a woman whose permanent office it is to do this, and who
has other women and girls with her to assist her, these others
including, but not necessarily being confined to, the females of the
dying man&rsquo;s own family and relatives. The house is full of women;
but there is no man there. This special woman and the others attend the
dying man,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5934src" href="#xd26e5934" name=
"xd26e5934src">1</a> nursing him, washing him from time to time, and
keeping the flies away from him; but they apparently do not attempt any
measures for curing him, their offices only beginning when he is
regarded as dying. In the meantime they all wail, and there are also a
number of other women wailing outside the house.</p>
<p>The special woman watches the dying person; and when she thinks he
is dead she gives him a heavy blow on the side of the head with her
fist, and pronounces him dead. She apparently does not feel his heart,
or do more than watch his face; and I should think it may often be that
in point of fact he is not dead when the blow is given, and might
perhaps have recovered.</p>
<p>Then the women inside the house say to one another that he is dead,
and communicate the news to the people outside; whereupon the men in
the village all commence shouting as loudly as they can. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5941" href="#xd26e5941" name=
"xd26e5941">244</a>]</span>The reason given for this shouting is that
it frightens away the man&rsquo;s ghost; but if so it is apparently
only a partial intimidation of the ghost, who, as will be seen
hereafter, is subjected to further alarms at a later stage. The men
communicate the news in the ordinary way adopted by these people of
shouting it across the valleys; and so it spreads to other villages,
and even to other communities. The man being dead, the wailing of the
women inside and outside the house is changed into a true funeral
wailing song; but this latter only continues for a few minutes. The
special woman and some others, probably relatives only, remain in the
house; but they do not touch the body at this stage. The other women,
probably non-relatives, go out. The relatives of the deceased, both men
and women, immediately smear their bodies with mud, but no one else in
the village does so.</p>
<p>This is the situation until the first party of women, generally
accompanied by men, begin to come in from other villages of the same,
and probably of one or more other, communities. These people have been
laughing and playing and enjoying themselves on their way to the
village, and do so freely until they get close to it. Then they
commence wailing (not the funeral song) and shouting, calling the
deceased by a relationship term, such as father, brother, etc., though
they may never have heard of him before; and, doing this, they enter
the village, and go to the house. The incoming women, but not the men,
all arrive smeared with mud. The women crowd into and about the house,
still wailing as before, but not the funeral song. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5945" href="#xd26e5945" name=
"xd26e5945">245</a>]</span>They all see the body; and each woman, after
seeing it, comes out and sits on the platform of the house or on the
ground outside. The party of outside village women then cease their
first wailing, and commence the funeral song, in which they are joined
by the female relatives of the deceased and other women of the village.
But again this only lasts for a few minutes, the period being longer or
shorter according to the importance of the person who has died.</p>
<p>Other similar parties, coming in from other villages, go through the
same performance as they come into the village; and in each case, as
the women of each fresh party come out of the house after seeing the
corpse, there is a fresh outburst of the funeral song on the part of
all the women present, but always only for a few minutes. This goes on
till the last batch of visitors has arrived. The people of the village
know when this last batch has come, because they have been told by
cross-valley shouting which villages are sending parties. The total
number of women in the village is then generally very large. After the
last batch of visitors has arrived, and until the funeral ceremony, all
the women again break out into the funeral song for a few minutes about
once an hour in the daytime, but not so often at night.</p>
<p>The funeral takes place probably about twenty-four hours after
death. The body is now wrapped up by the special woman attendant,
helped by the female relatives of the deceased, in leaves, especially
banana leaves, and bark of trees, and remains so wrapped up in the
house. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5951" href="#xd26e5951" name=
"xd26e5951">246</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is placed with the knees bent up to the chin, and the heels to
the buttocks. In the meantime men of the village dig a grave 2 or 3
feet deep in the village open enclosure. When all is ready the funeral
song begins again, the singers this time being the female relatives of
the deceased and the women who have come from outside villages, but not
the other women of the village of the deceased. Men of the village then
carry the corpse, wrapped and doubled up, and place it, lying on its
back, in the grave. There is no real procession from the house to the
grave, though all the people assemble at the latter; but during the
whole of the time, until the body is in the grave, the singing by the
women of the funeral song continues. As soon as the body is in the
grave, all the men, both villagers and visitors, shout again as before,
and for the same purpose. The grave is then filled up, the women in the
meantime singing as before; and when this is done the funeral is
over.</p>
<p>The relatives of the deceased now go into mourning. The widow or
widower or other nearest relative wears the mourning string necklace
already described. He or she, and also the other near relatives, smear
their faces, and sometimes, but not always, their bodies, with black,
to which, as regards the face, but not the body, is added oil or water.
Some more distant relatives, instead of blackening themselves, wear the
mourning shell necklace. And all this will continue, nominally without
break, until the mourning is formally removed, in the way to be
explained hereafter. As a matter of fact, the insignia of mourning are
not worn <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5956" href="#xd26e5956"
name="xd26e5956">247</a>]</span>without interruption, and the black
smearing is by no means so retained; but on any special occasion the
person would take care to appear in mourning. There is a custom under
which the widow or widower or other nearest relative may, instead of
wearing the mourning string necklace, abstain during the period of
mourning from eating some particular food, of which deceased was most
fond.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5958src" href="#xd26e5958" name=
"xd26e5958src">2</a></p>
<p>In connection with mourning, I should also mention a curious custom,
which I understand is common, though not universal, for a woman who has
lost a child, and especially a first-born or very clear child, to
amputate the top end of one of her fingers, up to the first joint, with
an adze. Having done this once for one child, she will possibly do it
again for another child; and a woman has been seen with three fingers
mutilated in this way.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5966src" href=
"#xd26e5966" name="xd26e5966src">3</a></p>
<p>The family of the deceased invite men and women from some other
community, but only one community, to a funeral feast, which is held
after an interval of two or three days from the day of the funeral. On
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5975" href="#xd26e5975" name=
"xd26e5975">248</a>]</span>the day appointed these guests arrive. They
are all well ornamented, but, with one exception, they do not wear
their dancing ornaments. One of them, however, usually a chief or the
son of a chief of the community invited, comes in his full dancing
ornaments. All the guest men bring with them their spears, and perhaps
adzes or clubs.</p>
<p>When they arrive the following performances take place, the village
enclosure being left by the villagers empty and open:&mdash;First two
guest women enter the village enclosure at one end, and run in silence
round it, brandishing spears in both hands, as at the big feast; but
they make no hostile demonstration. When these two women have reached
their starting point, they again do the same thing, brandishing their
spears as before, and all the guest men, except the specially dressed
one, follow them by advancing with a dancing step along the enclosure,
they also brandishing their spears, and also being silent. Thus the
whole group goes to the other end of the village, passing the grave of
the deceased as they do so; then they turn round, and come back again
in the same way, but on their return they stop before they reach the
grave.</p>
<p>Then the specially ornamented guest man enters alone, without his
arms, but with his drum, which he beats. He dances up the village
enclosure in a zigzag course, going from side to side of the enclosure,
and always facing in the direction in which he is at the time moving;
and during his advance he beats his drum., but otherwise he and all the
other <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5981" href="#xd26e5981" name=
"xd26e5981">249</a>]</span>people are silent. When in this way he has
reached the grave, the chief of the clan of the village where the
funeral takes place, who does not wear any dancing ornaments,
approaches him, and removes his heavy head ornament. This ends the
first part of the ceremony; and the villagers and guests then chat and
conduct themselves in the ordinary way.</p>
<p>Plates <a href="#p082">82</a> and <a href="#p083">83</a> illustrate
scenes at a funeral feast in the village of Amalala. In the former
plate the grave is very clear, and the remains of an older grave are
visible behind the post a little to the left. At the upper end of the
village enclosure are the visitors, who are about to dance along the
enclosure past the grave, and then back again up to it. The figures in
the <i>emone</i> behind are Amalala men, watching the performance. In
the latter plate the visitor chief is seen dancing along the village
enclosure towards the grave.</p>
<p>In the meantime the members of the family of the deceased bring in
one or more village pigs and some vegetables. A number of sticks are
laid upon the ground over the grave, the sticks crossing each other so
as to form a rude ground platform (this is not done by any particular
person), and these sticks are covered with banana leaves.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e5996src" href="#xd26e5996" name="xd26e5996src">4</a>
The pigs are placed on this platform, and are then killed by the
pig-killer and cut up, and the vegetables and pieces of pig are
distributed by the chief of the clan, helped perhaps by the family of
the deceased, among the male <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e5999"
href="#xd26e5999" name="xd26e5999">250</a>]</span>visitors. The one
specially dressed visitor, being the only one who has really danced,
gets much the largest share. For example, if there be two or more pigs,
he will get an entire pig for himself. Then the ceremony is over, and
the guests return home. The wood of the platform is not removed from
the grave, but is left to rot there. The killing of the pigs at this
ceremony is regarded as the act which will, they think, finally
propitiate or drive away the ghost of the departed.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that, though representatives from several
communities may be invited and come to the funeral, only one community
is invited to the subsequent funeral feast, just as only one community
is invited to the big feast, which latter we must, I think, associate
with the general superstitious idea of laying the ghosts of past
departed chiefs and notables. I cannot say what is the reason for the
confinement of these invitations to one community only, but it must, I
think, have had some definite origin<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6003src" href="#xd26e6003" name="xd26e6003src">5</a>; and as to
this I am struck by the similarity of the Massim idea, referred to by
Dr. Seligmann, that an individual&rsquo;s death primarily concerns the
dead man&rsquo;s hamlet and one other hamlet of his clan, with which
certain death feasts are exchanged, other members of the clan being
comparatively little affected.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6006src"
href="#xd26e6006" name="xd26e6006src">6</a></p>
<p>As soon as possible after the funeral pig-killing, they catch some
wild pig or pigs, and kill and eat them, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6013" href="#xd26e6013" name=
"xd26e6013">251</a>]</span>sweep down the village by way of
purification ceremony, very much as they do in the case of the big
feast, except that it is on a very much smaller scale, and that the
people do not afterwards leave the village.</p>
<p>The ceremony of removal of the mourning may take place after an
interval of only a week or two, or of so much as six months, the date
often depending upon the occurrence of some other ceremony, at which
the removal of the mourning can be carried out without necessitating a
ceremony for itself only. Visitors from some other community attend.
The ceremony only applies to the nearest relative&mdash;the person who
wears the string necklace; but, on his or her mourning being
ceremoniously removed, the mourning of all others in respect of the
same deceased ceases automatically.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6017src"
href="#xd26e6017" name="xd26e6017src">7</a> This nearest relative has
to provide a village pig. There is a feast, and dancing and pig-killing
and distribution of food and pig, in the usual way, and this may be in
the village of the deceased or in some other village of the community.
The pig-killing is done by the pig-killer under the platform of a
chiefs platform grave, or on the site of it. The pig, specially
provided by the nearest relative, is bought and paid for by some
person, as in the case of some of the ceremonies already described, and
this person, after the killing of the pig, without special ceremony,
cuts off the mourner&rsquo;s string necklace, dips it in the blood of
the pig, and throws it away; then he takes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6020" href="#xd26e6020" name=
"xd26e6020">252</a>]</span>some coloured paint, usually red, and with
it daubs two lines on each side of the face across the cheek of the
mourner, who of course at this ceremony will still have his black
paint. If the mourner has been refraining from food, instead of wearing
the necklace, the ceremony is confined to the paint-daubing. Then the
mourner pays this ceremonial pig-buyer for his services, probably in
feathers or dog-teeth, and the mourning is at an end.</p>
<p>There will at a later date be a purification ceremony, at which wild
pigs will be killed, such as has already been described.<a class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>(Chiefs.)</i></p>
<p>A dying chief is attended by the special woman and others in the way
above described, except that many women of the clan are there, and that
this special attendance and its accompanying wailing begin earlier,
perhaps two or three days earlier, than in the case of an ordinary
person, and that all the women of the clan who are not in the house
wail outside it.</p>
<p>In this case, however, there is a special ceremony for ascertaining
whether or not the chief is in fact going to die&mdash;a ceremony which
is usually performed at his own request. Some vegetable food, probably
sweet potato, or perhaps sugar-cane or taro, is given him to eat; and
this he will do although he may be <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6041" href="#xd26e6041" name="xd26e6041">253</a>]</span>very ill,
and may not have been taking food, though of course, if he were
insensible or unable to eat, this special ceremony could not be carried
out. The inedible portions of this food, <i>e.g.,</i> the peel of the
potato or the hard fibres of the sugar-cane, are then handed to certain
magical persons of the community, whose special duty it is to perform
the ceremony about to be described, but as to whom I was unable to
ascertain who and what they are, and whether they have any other
special functions besides those of this ceremony. Some of these
portions of food may even be sent to some similar magic person of high
reputation in another community, in order that he also may perform the
same ceremony. Each of these magic persons also has handed to him a
portion of a perineal band belonging to, and recently worn by, the
ailing chief.</p>
<p>Each of the magic men then wraps up the portion of food which has
been given to him in the piece of band; and this he again wraps up in
leaves, and continues doing so until the parcel has become a round ball
4 or 5 inches in diameter. The men then separate, and each of them goes
off alone to a spot outside the village, where he collects some very
dry firewood, and heaps it up against the trunk of a tree to a height
of, say, 6 feet. He then engages in an incantation, after which he puts
the ball inside the bottom of the wood pile, and lights the pile at the
bottom. Then he lies down by this fire and closes his eyes. After an
interval of perhaps two to five minutes he gets up, as though awakening
from a bad dream, and hears <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6048"
href="#xd26e6048" name="xd26e6048">254</a>]</span>the wailing in the
adjoining village, and asks himself what all this wailing is about; and
he then appears to remember for what purpose he is there, goes to the
fire, and takes out the ball. If the fire has burnt or scorched the
food wrapped up in the ball, it is an indication that the chief is to
die. If not, it indicates that he will live. These magic men then
return to the village, and report the result. If their report be that
the chief is going to live, the people cease their wailing, but if it
be that he is to die, the wailing continues.</p>
<p>Pausing here for a moment, I may admit that, though I have told the
tale of this ceremony, with its private cogitations&mdash;real or
pretended&mdash;of the magic men, as it was told to me, the tale is
open to obvious questions. How can a magic man from a distant community
hear the wailing? What would happen if the results of the ceremonies of
the various magic men were to differ? What would be the situation if a
chief whose death was indicated by the ceremony lived, or if one whose
recovery was foretold became worse and died? All these points I tried
to elucidate without success; but possibly the answer to the query as
to divergence of results may be that the men take care that the results
of their experiments shall not differ.</p>
<p>It is believed by the natives that, if a hostile community can
secure some of the food remnants and band, and hand them to their own
magic man, for him to go through the same ceremony, he may maliciously
bring about an unfavourable result, and thus may cause <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6054" href="#xd26e6054" name=
"xd26e6054">255</a>]</span>the death of the chief. If the belief that
such a thing had happened arose, it would be a <i>casus belli</i> with
that other community; and a case is known in which an inter-community
fight did occur on this ground.</p>
<p>If the report be that the chief is to die, the special woman
attendant will give him the blow on the head, as in the case of the
ordinary villager. The shouting of the men outside when the chiefs
death is announced is much louder than in the case of a commoner; and
as they shout they brandish their spears, and strike the roof of the
chiefs house with the spear points, and some of the men strike it with
adzes and clubs. The spreading of the news to other communities is on a
wider scale, and the number of people who respond to the news and come
to the funeral is very great, and includes a larger number of chiefs
and prominent men; there are more, and much larger, parties of them.
The funeral song of the women, commenced on the announcement of death,
lasts much longer&mdash;indeed for hours. In fact, as numerous large
bodies of people keep coming in, and some of these coming from a
distance may not arrive until just before the funeral, and as the
funeral song has to be recommenced as each fresh party comes in, and
lasts so much longer each time, it follows that this funeral song
practically continues without ceasing from the moment when death is
announced until the actual funeral. The immediate smearing by men and
women of their bodies with mud is done by all the members of the entire
community. When the guests reach the village, they are all, both
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6061" href="#xd26e6061" name=
"xd26e6061">256</a>]</span>men and women, smeared with mud, and they
loudly call on the dead chief by his title <i>amidi</i>, or as
<i>babe</i> (father). Also the various chiefs&rsquo; wives among the
guests remain in the house after seeing the body, instead of coming out
with the other guest women.</p>
<p>The funeral does not take place till thirty-six or forty-eight hours
after the death. The various chiefs&rsquo; wives take part in the
wrapping up of the body; and to the ordinary wrappings are added large
pieces of bark cloth.</p>
<p>The grave<a class="noteref" id="n256.1src" href="#n256.1" name=
"n256.1src">9</a> is quite different from that of a commoner. There are
two methods of sepulture adopted for chiefs, the grave being in both
cases in or by the edge of the open village enclosure.</p>
<p>The first of these methods is a burial platform, a very rough
erection of upright poles from 9 to 12 feet high, the number of which
may be four, or less or more than that, at the top of which erection is
a rude wooden box-shaped receptacle, about 2 or 3 feet square, and from
6 inches to a foot deep, and uncovered at the top, in which receptacle
the corpse is placed. Sometimes the supporting structure, instead of
being composed of a number of poles, is only a rough tree trunk, on
which the lower ends of the branches are left to support the box.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6078" href="#xd26e6078" name=
"xd26e6078">257</a>]</span></p>
<p>The second method is tree burial. The tree in which this is done is
a special form of fig tree called <i>gabi</i>, the burial box, similar
to the one above described, being placed in its lowest fork, or, if
that be already occupied, then in the next one, and so on.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6085src" href="#xd26e6085" name=
"xd26e6085src">10</a> A tree has been seen with six of these boxes in
it, one above another. This tree is specially used for such burials.
The natives will never cut it down. In selecting a village site they
will often specially choose one where one of these trees is growing;
and indeed the presence of such a tree in the bush raises a probability
that there is, or has been, a native village there.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6091src" href="#xd26e6091" name="xd26e6091src">11</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6131" href="#xd26e6131" name=
"xd26e6131">258</a>]</span></p>
<p>If a burial platform afterwards falls down through decay, the people
throw away all the bones, except the skull and the larger bones of the
arms and legs; and these they deal with in one of three alternative
ways. They either (1) dig a shallow grave in the ground under the
fallen platform, and put the skull and special bones there, and then
fill in the grave with soil, on this put a heap of stones, and on these
put the wooden remains of the collapsed platform, planting round them
tobacco or croton, or some other fine-leaved plant, or (2) they put the
skull and special bones in a box on the <i>gabi</i> burying tree, or
(3) they take them to the <i>emone</i>, and there hang them up till
they are wanted for a big feast. In the same way, if a tree box falls,
they retain only the skull and large arm and leg bones, and replace
them in a new box in the same tree.</p>
<p>We have already seen a chiefs burial platform in the two plates
<a href="#p069">69</a> and <a href="#p070">70</a> relating to the big
feast at Seluku, and the following plates are additional
illustrations:&mdash;<a href="#p084">Plate 84</a> is the grave of a
chiefs child in the village of Malala. The supports of the grave rise
from the village enclosure fence behind, and are quite distinct from
the underground commoner&rsquo;s grave, which is seen in front.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6151" href="#xd26e6151" name=
"xd26e6151">259</a>]</span>The positions of the two graves can be seen
in the general view of the village (<a href="#p058">Plate 58</a>).
<a href="#p085">Plate 85</a> is a group of graves of chiefs and
chiefs&rsquo; relatives in the village of Tullalave (community of
Auga). <a href="#p086">Plate 86</a> shows the grave of a chiefs child
in the village of Faribe (community of Faribe). The form of this grave
is quite different from those of the others, and is not, I think, so
common, but a grave somewhat resembling it is seen in <a href=
"#p060">Plate 60</a>.</p>
<p><a href="#p087">Plate 87</a> is a <i>gabi</i> fig tree, used for
tree burial, near to the village of Seluku, and <a href="#p088">Plate
88</a> shows the remains of an old burial box in one of its forks. The
bones are still in this box, and indeed one of them may be just
discerned at the extreme left, close to the upright stem of the
tree.</p>
<p><a href="#p089">Plate 89</a> illustrates what I have said as to what
is done when a burial platform falls down from decay. The skull and
larger arm and leg bones of the body have been buried underground, and
upon these have been heaped first stones and then the remains of the
collapsed platform, and one little foliage plant and dried-up looking
specimens of others can be seen around it. This picture was taken in
the village of Seluku, and the actual position of the grave in the
village enclosure is seen in <a href="#p055">Plate 55</a>. <a href=
"#p090">Plate 90</a>, of an <i>emone</i> in the village of Voitele
(community of Sivu) illustrates the alternative plan of hanging the
skull and bones up in the <i>emone</i>.</p>
<p>At the funeral all the women present, those of the village and of
the whole community and the guests, join in singing the funeral song;
but here again there is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6194" href=
"#xd26e6194" name="xd26e6194">260</a>]</span>no actual procession, and
the carrying of the body is not necessarily entrusted to any particular
person. When the grave, whether on a platform or on a tree, is reached,
all the men present begin to shout loudly, and there is a terrible
noise. They all have their spears, but there is no brandishing of them.
Then some men (anyone may do this) climb up to the box, and others hand
the wrapped body up to them, and they place it lying on its back in the
box. This ends the actual burial ceremony.</p>
<p>The black mourning face, and sometimes body-staining is then adopted
by all the people of the community, and perhaps also by chiefs from
other communities who have been friends of the dead chief. The special
string necklace worn by the nearest relative and the other family
emblems of mourning are the same as in the case of an ordinary person,
except that the chiefs widow will probably also wear the special
mourning network vest already described, and that the mourning shell
necklace, which in the case of an ordinary man is only worn by distant
relatives, is worn by all the married men and women of the clan who
have or can procure it.</p>
<p>The subsequent ceremony and feast are in this case held one or two
days after the funeral, the acceleration in the case of a chief being
necessary in consequence of the retention of the corpse above ground
and the foul smell which immediately begins to emanate from it. This
feast is on a very large scale, though here again only one community is
invited. The guests enter the village just as they do in the case of
the death of an <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6200" href=
"#xd26e6200" name="xd26e6200">261</a>]</span>ordinary person; but they
are all specially well decorated, and the one guest who comes in full
dancing ornaments will certainly be a chief, or at least a chiefs son.
The subsequent part of the ceremony, up to the removal of the head
feather ornament from the dancer, is the same; but this removal is done
by the nearest male relative of the deceased chief, who will probably
be the person to whom the chieftainship has descended. Then follows the
feast itself. The vegetables and village pigs for the feast are
provided by the whole clan, and are in very large quantities. No
platform of sticks is placed on the grave, the grave in this case not
being underground; but the banana leaves are placed around (not under)
the supports of the burial platform, or around the trunk of the burial
tree. The pigs are killed upon these banana leaves by the pig-killer
and his helpers, and the killed pigs are then placed in circles around
the platform or tree, and are there cut up. The distribution of food
and pig&rsquo;s flesh is made by the chiefs nearest male relative, with
assistance, here again the special dancer getting the largest share,
and the ceremony is then over, and the guests return to their
villages.</p>
<p>And now a true desertion of the village by its inhabitants takes
place, as indeed is necessary, as the putrefying body is becoming so
offensive; and it will be at least two or three weeks before the
emission of the smells is over. The villagers all go off into the bush,
with the exception of two unhappy men, more or less close relatives of
the dead chief, who have to remain in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6204" href="#xd26e6204" name="xd26e6204">262</a>]</span>the
village. Whilst there alone they are well ornamented, though not in
their full dancing decoration, but in particular, though not themselves
chiefs, they wear on their heads the cassowary feathers which are the
distinctive decoration of a chief, and they carry their spears. There
they remain amidst the awful stench of the decomposing body and all the
mess and smell of the pigs&rsquo; blood and garbage about the village.
It is a curious fact that, in speaking of these two men, the natives do
not speak of them as watching over the body of the chief, but as
watching over the blood of the killed pigs.</p>
<p>When the stench is over, the villagers in the bush are informed, and
they then return to the village. Then follow the killing and eating of
wild pigs and sweeping down of the village, as in the case of the death
of an ordinary person, but again on a much larger scale.</p>
<p>It will be noticed that, though the desertion of the village after a
big feast lasts for six months, that which follows a chiefs funeral
only lasts for a few weeks.</p>
<p>The removal of the mourning takes place after an interval which may
be anything between one and six months. This is a special ceremony, and
will not be postponed for the purpose of tacking it on to some other
ceremony, as in the case of an ordinary person&rsquo;s mourning
removal; but other ceremonies will often be tacked on to it. The guests
invited are from only one other community. Here again the person
actually dealt with is the chief mourner, and the removal of mourning
from him or her terminates the mourning for <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6213" href="#xd26e6213" name=
"xd26e6213">263</a>]</span>everyone. The village pigs for this occasion
are provided by the dead man&rsquo;s family, and not by the whole clan,
as in the case of a chiefs funeral feast. There will probably be two or
three of such pigs provided; but, as the ceremony is also available for
various other ceremonies, there may be a considerable number of pigs
killed. The dancing and pig-killing and feast are the same as those of
an ordinary mourning-removal ceremony, but on a larger scale. The
pig-killing in this case is done round the platform or tree on which
the chief is buried. The buyer of the pig, who cuts off the mourning
necklace and daubs the face of the chief mourner, if not a chief, will
at all events be a person of importance; but the ceremonies relating to
all these matters are identical with those already described. There is
also the subsequent purification ceremony, at which wild pigs are
killed and eaten as before.</p>
<p>The graves of chiefs&rsquo; wives and members of their families, and
other persons of special importance, are platform or tree graves, like
those of chiefs, and the funeral ceremonies on the deaths of these
people are very similar to those of chiefs, though they are on a scale
which is smaller, in proportion to the relative smallness of the
importance of the person to be buried; and they are subject to a few
detailed differences, which the difference of the situation involves.
The special magic ceremony for ascertaining if the patient is or is not
going to die is not performed in the case of these people. <span class=

Platform burial in one form or another is not peculiar to the Mafulu
district. It is perhaps common among many of the mountain people. Sir
William Macgregor found it in the mountains of the Vanapa watershed
(<i>Annual Report</i>, 1897&ndash;8, pp. 22 and 23), and Dr. Seligmann
regards it, I think, as a custom among the general class of what he
calls &ldquo;Kama-weka&rdquo; (<i>Melanesians of British New
Guinea</i>, p. 32). Mr. J.&nbsp;P. Thomson records its occurrence even
in the lower waters of the Kemp Welch river (<i>British New Guinea</i>,
p. 53, and see also his further references to the matter on pp. 59 and
67). In view of a suggestion which I make in my concluding chapter as
to the possible origin of the Mafulu people, it is also interesting to
note that platform or tree burial is, or used to be, adopted, for
important people only, by the Semang of the Malay Peninsula and the
Andamanese. As regards the Semang, though they now employ a simple form
of interment, their more honourable practice was to expose the dead in
trees (Skeat and Blagden, <i>Pagan Races of the Malay Peninsula</i>,
Vol. II., p. 89); and, though the bodies of the Pangan (East Coast
Semang) lay members were buried in the ground, those of their great
magicians were deposited in trees (<i>Ibid.</i>, Vol. II., p. 91); and
apparently this was the case among the Semang as regards the bodies of
chiefs (<i>Ibid.</i>, Vol. I., p. 587). And concerning the Andamanese
it is recorded that the skeleton of a man who, for reasons given, was
believed to have been a chief was found lying on a platform of sticks
placed across forks of a tree about 12 feet from the ground, a mode
which was compared with the method of underground burial which had
previously been met with (<i>Transactions of the Ethnological Society,
New Series</i>, Vol. V. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6115" href=
"#xd26e6115" name="xd26e6115">258</a>]</span>p. 42). Mr. Portman
records (<i>History of our Relations with the Andamanese</i>, Vol. II.,
p. 547) similar tree burial of two chiefs and the wife of a chief, and
refers to the practice of burying underground &ldquo;or, what is more
honourable,&rdquo; on a platform up in a tree (<i>Ibid</i>., Vol. I.,
p. 43). The practice is also mentioned by Mr. Man, who, after referring
(<i>The Andaman Islanders</i>, p. 76) to underground interment and
platform burial, of which &ldquo;the latter is considered the more
complimentary,&rdquo; states (pp. 76 and 77) that a small stage is
constructed of sticks and boughs about 8 to 12 feet above the ground,
<i>generally</i> (the italics are mine) between the forked branches of
some large tree, and to it the body is lashed.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow"

<p class="first">These are subjects which I should hardly have ventured
to introduce into this book if I had had to rely exclusively upon
enquiries made only during my stay among the Mafulu villages, without
having the benefit of five years&rsquo; observation by the Mafulu
Fathers of the Mission. And, notwithstanding this additional facility,
my notes on these questions will be found to involve puzzles and
apparent inconsistencies; and there is no part of the book which should
be read and accepted with greater reserve and doubt as to possible
misunderstanding. Subject to this caution, I give the information as I
have obtained it.</p>
<p>I heard nothing to justify the idea of the Mafulu people having any
belief in a universal God or All Father; but there is a general belief
among them in a mysterious individual named <i>Tsidibe</i>, who may be
a man, or may be a spirit (they appear to be vague as to this), who has
immense power, and who once passed through their country in a direction
from east to west. Wherever you may be, if you speak of this
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6231" href="#xd26e6231" name=
"xd26e6231">265</a>]</span>personage, and ask to be told in which
direction he travelled, they always point out one which is from east to
west. They believe that it was <i>Tsidibe</i> who taught them all their
customs, including dancing and manufacture, and that he ultimately
reached and remained in the land of the white man, where he is now
living; and that the superior knowledge of the white man in
manufacture, and especially in the making of clothes, has been acquired
from him. The idea of his ultimate association with the white man can
hardly, however, be a very ancient tradition. One of the Fathers was
seriously asked by a native whether he had ever seen <i>Tsidibe</i>.
They seem to think that he is essentially a beneficent being. They
regret his having left their country; but they have no doubt as to
this, and do not regard him as still continuing to exercise any
influence over them and their affairs, have no ceremonies or
observances with reference to him, and do not address to him any
supplications. As traces of his passage through their country they will
show you extraordinarily shaped rocks and stones, such as fragments
which have fallen from above into the valley, and rocks and stones
which have lodged in strange positions. But there are no ceremonies
with reference to these and the natives have no fear of them, and
indeed they will proudly point them out to you as evidences of this
mysterious being having been in their country, and of his power. They
would not hesitate to touch one of these stones, but they would never
injure it. I learnt nothing about him which would justify me in
suggesting that the Mafulu people <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6239" href="#xd26e6239" name="xd26e6239">266</a>]</span>deified
him as an ancestor, or even regarded him as being one, though some of
the matters attributed to him are perhaps not dissimilar from those
often attributed to deified ancestors.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6242src" href="#xd26e6242" name="xd26e6242src">1</a></p>
<p>They certainly have a lively belief in ghosts of people who have
lived and died, and in spirits which have never occupied human form,
all of whom (ghosts and spirits) are evil disposed, and in sorcery.</p>
<p>Every human being, male and female, has during life a mysterious
ghostly self, in addition to his bodily visible and conscious self; and
this ghostly self will on his death survive him as a ghost. There
appears to be no idea of this ghostly self leaving the body in times of
sleeping or dreaming; though, if a man dreams of someone who is dead,
he thinks that he has been visited by that person&rsquo;s ghost.</p>
<p>At death the ghost leaves the body, and becomes, and remains, a
malevolent being. There is no idea of re-incarnation, or of the ghost
passing into any animal or plant, though, as will be seen hereafter, it
sometimes apparently <i>becomes</i> a plant; and there is no difference
in their minds between the case of a person <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6269" href="#xd26e6269" name=
"xd26e6269">267</a>]</span>who has died naturally and one who has been
killed in battle or otherwise, or between persons who have or have not
been eaten, or who have or have not been buried, though in case of
burial there are the methods of getting rid of the ghost; and there is
no superstitious avoidance of graves or fear of mentioning a deceased
person by name, and no superstition as to the shadows of living persons
passing over graves and sacred places. Except as above stated, I found
no trace of any belief in a future state.</p>
<p>When on the death of a man or woman or child, the ghostly self
leaves the body, or at all events when the funeral pig-killing has been
performed, the ghost goes away to the tops of the mountains, where
apparently it exists as a ghost for ever. The shouting immediately
after the death, and afterwards at the funeral, are steps towards
driving it there; and the pig-killing ceremony completes the process.
On reaching the mountains the ghost <i>becomes</i> one of two things.
The ghost of a young or grown-up person up to, say, forty or forty-five
years of age becomes the shimmering light upon the ground and
undergrowth, which occurs here and there where the dense forest of the
mountains is penetrated by the sun&rsquo;s beams. It is apparently only
the light which shimmers on the ground and undergrowth, and not that in
the air. The ghost of an elderly person over forty or forty-five years
of age becomes a large sort of fungus, which is indigenous to the
mountains, where alone it is found. Any native who on a hunting
expedition or otherwise meets with a glade in which this shimmering
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6276" href="#xd26e6276" name=
"xd26e6276">268</a>]</span>light occurs will carefully pass round it,
instead of going across it; and any native finding one of these fungi
will neither eat nor touch, nor even tread upon it; though indeed, as
regards the eating, I understand that this particular fungus is one of
the poisonous non-edible forms. A native who, after the recent death of
another, is travelling in the mountains, and there finds a young fungus
of this species only just starting into growth, will think that it is
probably the ghost of the recently departed one.</p>
<p>As regards the use by me with reference to both sunbeams and fungi
of the word &ldquo;<i>becomes</i>&rdquo; I recognise that it may
justify much doubt and questioning. The idea of actually
<i>becoming</i> the flickering light or the fungus, as distinguished
from that of entering into or haunting it, is a difficult one to grasp,
especially as regards the flickering light. I tried to get to the
bottom of this question when I was at Mafulu; but the belief as to
actual <i>becoming</i> was insisted upon, and I could get no further. I
cannot doubt, however, that there is much room for further
investigation on the point, which is of a character concerning which
misapprehension may well arise, especially in dealing with such simple
and primitive people as are the Mafulu natives.</p>
<p>The foods of these ghosts in both their forms are the ghostly
elements of the usual native vegetable foods (sweet potato, yam, taro,
banana, and in fact every vegetable food) and the ghostly elements of
the excrement of the still living natives; and the ghosts come down
from the mountains to the villages and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6291" href="#xd26e6291" name="xd26e6291">269</a>]</span>gardens
to procure these foods. Here again the difficulty as to meaning above
referred to arises, as they can hardly imagine that the flickering
lights cease to flicker in their mountain glades, or that the fungi
cease to exist in their mountain habitats during these food-seeking
incursions; and yet, unless this be so, the superstitious difficulty is
increased. A ghost is also sometimes for some reason or other
dissatisfied with his mountain abode; and he will then return to the
village (not apparently in the visible form of a flickering light or a
fungus).</p>
<p>As the intentions of the ghost towards living humanity are always
evil, his visits, whether for procuring food or in consequence of
dissatisfaction with his habitat, are feared by the people; but I could
not ascertain what was the nature of the injuries by the ghost to
themselves of which they were afraid, nor could I hear of any actual
instance of a disaster or misfortune which had been attributed to the
machinations of such a ghost. When sleeping in their dark enclosed
houses, however, the people fill up all openings by which the ghost
might enter (this does not apply to the <i>emone</i>, the entrance
openings of which are not closed at night; but perhaps the fact that a
number of men are always sleeping together there gives them
confidence); and when the Mission Station at Mafulu was started the
natives were amazed at the missionaries daring to sleep alone in rooms
with open doors and windows, through which the ghosts might enter.</p>
<p>Having by the shouting prior to and at the dead <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6300" href="#xd26e6300" name=
"xd26e6300">270</a>]</span>man&rsquo;s funeral wholly or partially
driven his ghost to the mountains, and in some way, as it would seem,
further placated or influenced the ghost by the subsequent pig-killing
over or by his grave at the funeral feast, there is no method of which
I could gain information by which the people can actually keep him
there, or prevent his periodic returns to the village and gardens for
food, or his return from a mountain home with which he is dissatisfied;
and there are apparently no prayers, incantations or other ceremonies
for the purpose of placating, or intimidating, or in any way
influencing the ghost. This statement is subject, however, to the
existence of the practice of pig-killing at the various other
ceremonies before described (always apparently done under or by or on
the site of a chiefs grave), which is evidently superstitious in
character, and must have reference to the ghosts of the departed chiefs
and notables, being intended, or having originally been intended, to
placate or influence them in some way or other; and especially it would
seem that this must be so as regards the dipping of the mourner&rsquo;s
string necklace in dead pigs&rsquo; blood at the mourning-removal
ceremony, and as regards the pig-killing at the big feast, at which the
skulls and bones of all the then departed chiefs and notables are
carefully collected, and made the objects of ceremonious dipping in
blood, or touching with bones so dipped, and after which these skulls
and bones may be thrown away, as not requiring further ceremony. And
concerning all these ceremonies, if we bear in mind the special fear
which many primitive people <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6302"
href="#xd26e6302" name="xd26e6302">271</a>]</span>seem to have of the
ghosts of their great men, as distinguished from those of the
unimportant ones, it seems, I think, to be natural that the graves and
the skulls and bones of the great ones should be those which are
specially dealt with, and the dealing with which may possibly, so far
as the big feasts are concerned, have been the original purpose for
which the feasts were held.</p>
<p>The mental attitude and conduct of the people towards ghosts may
have originated in some form of ancestor worship, but I found nothing
now existing to indicate this; and in particular I could learn nothing
of any recognition of, or ceremonial observances with reference to, the
individual ghosts of known persons, as distinguished from the ghosts
generally.</p>
<p>I could find no direct information as to any belief in ghosts of
animals or plants; but the fact that the living edible plants have a
ghostly self, upon which the human ghosts feed, seems to involve the
idea during the life of those plants; and in that case one sees no
reason why the ghost of the plant should not survive the plant itself,
just as the ghost of the living person survives him at his death. Also
the existence of a ghostly element in human excrement opens out a wide
field of ghostly possibilities.</p>
<p>Spirits which have never been human beings are also malevolent;
though when we come to the operations of magic men or sorcerers, and to
incantations and the use of charms, the powers in connection with all
of which appear to be ascribed to spirits, it will be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6311" href="#xd26e6311" name=
"xd26e6311">272</a>]</span>noticed that these are by no means
necessarily and invariably engaged or used for malevolent purposes.</p>
<p>I was not able to obtain any satisfactory information as to these
spirits, or their supposed attributes, nor, except as regards illness
and death, as to the nature of, and ground for, the fears which the
natives feel concerning them; indeed, this is a subject upon which most
natives all over the world are inclined to be reticent, partly or
largely from fear. Even as regards the sacred places which these
spirits are supposed to haunt, though the natives are not unwilling to
pass them, and will mention the fact that they are sacred, they are
unwilling to talk about them. My notes as to spirits, other than those
in connection with sorcery producing illness and death, must therefore
be practically confined to the sacred places haunted by the spirits,
and the demeanour and acts of the natives with reference to, and when
they pass, these places.</p>
<p>Speaking generally, any place which has something specially peculiar
or unusual in its appearance is likely to be regarded as the abode of a
spirit. A waterfall, or a deep still pool in the course of a river (but
not the river itself), or a deep narrow rocky river ravine, or a
strangely shaped rock come under this category. There are also certain
trees and creepers which are regarded as implying the presence of a
spirit in their vicinity, although that vicinity has in itself nothing
unusual. I can, however, only give a few illustrative examples of this
general idea.</p>
<p>There are three special trees and two or three <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6319" href="#xd26e6319" name=
"xd26e6319">273</a>]</span>special creepers which imply the presence of
a spirit. What the creepers are I could not ascertain; but the trees
are a very large palm which grows on the mountains and not on the
coast, a form of pine tree,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6321src" href=
"#xd26e6321" name="xd26e6321src">2</a> and the <i>gabi</i> fig-tree,
used for burial of chiefs.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6327src" href=
"#xd26e6327" name="xd26e6327src">3</a> It does not necessarily follow
that every specimen of any one of these trees and creepers is
spirit-haunted; but some are known to be so, and all are apparently so
much under suspicion that, though the natives will speak of them and
will pass them, they are afraid to cut them down.</p>
<p>At the time when the path near the newly erected Mission Station at
Mafulu was being opened some of these creepers had to be cleared away,
and the Mission Fathers had the utmost difficulty with the natives,
only two or three of whom could be persuaded to help in the work,
whilst the others stood aloof and afraid. In the same way, when the
Fathers wanted to cut down some of the special palms, only two natives
were induced to help in this, and even they only did so on the
condition that the Fathers themselves made the first strokes; and the
Fathers were warned by the natives that evil would befall them. It was
a curious coincidence that the Father who did this tree-cutting, being
then and having been for a long time past <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6344" href="#xd26e6344" name="xd26e6344">274</a>]</span>perfectly
well in health, was that evening taken ill with a bad sore, which
nearly necessitated his being carried down to the head Mission Station
on the coast.</p>
<p>There is a very common ceremony performed when natives, in
travelling through the country, pass a spirit-haunted spot. The leader
of the party turns round, and in a low voice tells the others that they
are approaching the spot, whereupon they all become silent, though up
to that point they have been chattering. The leader then takes a wisp
of grass and ties it in a knot, and all the others do the same. They
then walk on in silence for a period, which may be anything from five
to fifteen minutes, after which, as they pass the spot, the leader
turns round and throws his bunch of grass on the ground, and the others
do the same. In this way they avert the danger and afterwards chatter
as before.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6348src" href="#xd26e6348" name=
"xd26e6348src">4</a> Another somewhat similar ceremony commences, like
the former one, with silence; but, instead of throwing grass down as
they pass the haunted spot, the visible sign of which in this case is a
hole in the ground, the leader stops and looks round at the others, and
then presses the palm of his hand down into the interior of the hole,
and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6354" href="#xd26e6354"
name="xd26e6354">275</a>]</span>others do the same; and after this all
is safe and well, as in the former case. In travelling through the
country these holes with numerous impressions of hands in them are to
be seen; and you may in one day&rsquo;s journey pass several of these
signs of haunted places, of either or both sorts, within a
comparatively short distance of one another. The hole in which the
people put their hands may not have originally existed, and may have
been produced by the oft-repeated pressure of hands on the ground as
natives passed the haunted spot; but on this point I am unable to make
any statement. Nor have I been able to ascertain what the difference,
if any, is, or has been, between the places where they put grass and
those in which they merely press the hands.</p>
<p>I found no evidence of any general idea of supernatural powers being
possessed by natural inanimate objects, such as rivers or rocks; but,
as already stated, fishers are in the habit of addressing the stream in
supplication for fish, and it is possible there are other examples of
the same sort of thing, which I did not discover.</p>
<p>Magic or sorcery, and those who practise it, and incantations and
charms, and those who supply charms, are naturally associated with
either ghosts or spirits, or both. Among the Mafulu people they are, I
was assured, associated solely with spirits, and not with ghosts; and,
though I have no confirmatory evidence of the accuracy of this
statement, I can only in these notes assume that it is correct. It may
well be, however, that in the minds of the people themselves the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6360" href="#xd26e6360" name=
"xd26e6360">276</a>]</span>distinction between the ghost of a person
who has lived and died and the spirit which has never lived in visible
human form is not really quite clearly defined; or that powers which
are now regarded by them as spirits have had an origin, possibly long
ago, in what were then believed to be ghosts. I shall revert to this
point at a later stage.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Sorcery.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Mafulu magic men or sorcerers are different from
those of the Mekeo plains. There is not among the Mafulu, as there is
in Mekeo, a large body of powerful professional sorcerers, who are a
source of constant terror to the other people of their own villages,
and are yet to a certain extent relied upon and desired by those people
as a counterpoise to the powers of sorcerers of other villages; and a
Mafulu native, unless prevented by a fear of outside hostility in no
way connected with the supernatural, will travel alone outside his own
community in a way in which fear of the sorcerers would make a Mekeo
native unwilling to do so. The Mafulu sorcerers are a somewhat less
powerful people; but they claim, and are supposed to have, certain
powers of divination, or actual causation, or both, of certain things.
So far as I could learn, the sorcerer&rsquo;s supernatural powers would
never be exercised in a hostile way against anyone of his own village,
or indeed of his own clan, or even, as a rule, of his own community.
Apparently the sorcerer&rsquo;s victim is nearly always a member of
some other community; and the sorcerers <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6367" href="#xd26e6367" name="xd26e6367">277</a>]</span>of a
community do not appear to be in any way either feared or shunned by
the members of that community. And, even as regards their acts of
hostility against members of other communities, these do not seem to be
performed to an extent in any way approaching what is found in
Mekeo.</p>
<p>It seemed to me at first, as regards these sorcerers, that there was
a confusion in the Mafulu mind between divination and causation. The
question as to this arose specially in connection with the ceremony for
ascertaining whether a chief was or was not going to die. The people of
a clan and the ailing chief certainly assume that the sorcerers who
perform the ceremony under instructions, whether they be of the same
community or of some other community, will by their magical powers
merely divine the death or recovery of the chief; and the idea does not
enter their heads that these sorcerers may actually cause the death.
And yet they will accuse a hostile sorcerer of causing the death by an
exactly similar ceremony, and will go to war over the matter. Probably,
however, it is rather a question of the sorcerer&rsquo;s assumed
volition&mdash;that is, it is assumed that the friendly sorcerer does
not want the chief to die, and the people rely upon him to confine
himself to a divination ceremony, and not to engage in hostile sorcery;
whereas a hostile sorcerer might do the latter. I may add that I was
led to suspect that the burning test was regarded as being only a
matter of divination, and that the causation, if it occurred, was
effected by means of the previous incantation. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6371" href="#xd26e6371" name=
"xd26e6371">278</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are also, besides the sorcerers, a number of specialists, who
can hardly perhaps be called true sorcerers, but who have certain
specific powers, or are acquainted with certain specific forms of
incantation, and whose services are from time to time sought by the
people. It is impossible for me to point to any definite line of
demarcation between the true sorcerers and these smaller people; and it
cannot be doubted that the powers of the latter, like those of the
former, are, or have been, based upon the supernatural, even though
they themselves do not claim to be and are not regarded as being magic
men in the highest sense. I think I may regard them as being more or
less the Mafulu equivalents of the Roro individuals whom Dr. Seligmann
calls &ldquo;departmental experts.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6374src" href="#xd26e6374" name="xd26e6374src">5</a></p>
<p>Dealing first with the true sorcerers, they undoubtedly include
among their number the men who perform the special ceremonial already
described for ascertaining whether a sick chief is or is not destined
to die. They also seem to include the makers or providers of the
various charms, including those which are carried in the little charm
bags and the love charms used by young men, as already mentioned. There
are also two other matters which are regarded as coming within the
province of the true sorcerers, of which one relates to rain and the
other relates to illness and death. I will deal with them
separately.</p>
<p>The rain sorcerer is apparently merely a diviner. Dr. Seligmann
would perhaps include him among the departmental experts, but the
Fathers of the Mission <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6383" href=
"#xd26e6383" name="xd26e6383">279</a>]</span>regard him as being a true
sorcerer. He is the man to whom the people go in anticipation of a
proposed important event, such as a big feast, or perhaps a fighting or
large hunting expedition, to ascertain and inform them whether the
period in which it is proposed that the event shall occur will be fine
or wet; but he does not profess to be able to do more than this, and
they never expect him to prevent or bring about the rain, or in any way
hold him responsible for the weather as it may in fact eventually
occur.</p>
<p>The sorcery connected with illness and death is not so simple; and
there is no doubt that it is not confined to powers of divination, but
includes powers of actual causation. This department of sorcery
obviously includes the ceremonial in connection with the supposed dying
chief. But it is not confined to this ceremony, as it is generally
believed by the Mafulu people that sickness, which does not necessarily
end in death, and death itself, can be, and commonly is, brought about
by the operation of sorcerers in one way or another through the medium
of certain things. The only things of this nature concerning which I
was able to obtain information are (1) the inedible part of some
vegetable food which the victim has recently eaten (<i>e.g.,</i> the
outside part of a sweet potato or banana or the cane part of a sugar
cane), and (2) the victim&rsquo;s discharged excrement or urine. I
found no trace of any use for purposes of sorcery of the edible
remnants of the victim&rsquo;s food, nor (except as regards a
woman&rsquo;s placenta, to which I shall refer presently) of any part
of his body, such as his hair or nails; and, in fact, the free way in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6390" href="#xd26e6390" name=
"xd26e6390">280</a>]</span>which the natives throw away their hair when
cut is inconsistent with any belief as to its possible use against
them.</p>
<p>First, the inedible remnants of recently consumed vegetable food.
The use of this as a medium for causing illness and death is apparently
confined to the case of a victim who has passed the stage of very young
childhood. Why this is so I could not learn; though in point of fact a
mere infant would hardly be eating such things as a regular practice. A
man or woman, however, never carelessly throws aside his own food
remnants of this character; and his reason for this is fear of sorcery.
He carefully keeps them under his control until he can take them to a
river, into which he throws them, after which they are harmless as a
medium against him. The fear concerning these remains is that a
sorcerer will use them for a ceremony somewhat similar to that
described in connection with the death of a chief, but in a hostile
way. No such precautions are taken with reference to similar food eaten
by very young children.</p>
<p>Secondly, the discharged excrement and urine. This, for some reason,
only applies to the case of an infant or quite young child. Here again
I could not learn the reason for the limitation; but it is confirmed by
the fact that grown-up persons take no pains whatever to avoid the
passing of these things into the possession of other people, whereas,
as regards little children, the mothers or other persons having charge
of them always take careful precautions. The mother picks up her little
child&rsquo;s excrement, and wraps it in a leaf, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6396" href="#xd26e6396" name=
"xd26e6396">281</a>]</span>and then either carefully hides it in a hole
in the ground, or throws it into the river, or places it in a little
raised-up nest-like receptacle, which is sometimes erected near the
house for this purpose, and where also it is regarded as being safe.
One of these receptacles, shaped like an inverted cone, is shown in
<a href="#p091">Plate 91</a>, and a somewhat similar one is seen in
<a href="#p064">Plate 64</a>. As regards the urine, she pours upon it,
as it lies on the ground or on the house floor or platform, a little
clean water which she obtains from any handy source, or sometimes from
a little store which, when away from other water supply, she often
carries about with her for the purpose. I could get no information as
to the way in which the sorcerer would use the excrement or urine as a
medium for hostile purposes; though there is apparently no process
similar to that of the fire used in connection with the inedible food
remnants of the adult.</p>
<p>It will have been noticed that the mode of rendering the inedible
food remnants of a grown-up person immune from sorcery, and one of the
methods of making the infants&rsquo; excrement immune, is that of
throwing them into the river; and even as regards infants&rsquo; urine,
which apparently is not, and as a rule hardly could be, actually thrown
into the river, the protection is obtained by pouring water upon it. I
think that the belief among the islands of the Pacific in the power of
water to protect against the machinations of spirits or ghosts is not
confined to the Mafulu natives, or indeed to those of New Guinea. Dr.
Codrington mentions its existence as regards human excrement in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6406" href="#xd26e6406" name=
"xd26e6406">282</a>]</span>Melanesia.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6408src" href="#xd26e6408" name="xd26e6408src">6</a> I would also
refer to a custom of the Mafulu women after childbirth of throwing the
placenta into the river, a practice which is similar to that of the
Koita women, who drop the placenta into the sea.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6413src" href="#xd26e6413" name="xd26e6413src">7</a> Probably
these practices relating to placenta are also based upon some idea of
protection from sorcerers and spirits, although I was informed that
among the Mafulu there is no superstitious fear connected with the
matter now. If the custom is in fact superstitious in origin, the list
of media for the use of sorcery already given by me requires
enlarging.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6419src" href="#xd26e6419" name=
"xd26e6419src">8</a></p>
<p>Serious illness or death of either an adult or an infant, if not
caused by visible accident, is by the Mafulu, as by other natives,
generally attributed, subject to limitations, to the sorcerers. The
belief of the Mafulu as to this arises if the victim, being an ordinary
person, is comparatively young, or in the strength of life, say under
forty or forty-five, or if the victim, being a chief or a member of a
chief&rsquo;s family or a person of very high position, is even over
that age, unless he is very old, and old age is recognised as the
natural cause of his illness or death.</p>
<p>If the belief arises that the calamity, especially that of death,
has been brought about by spiritualistic <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6430" href="#xd26e6430" name=
"xd26e6430">283</a>]</span>influence, the family will probably go to
some person who is believed to be in touch with spirits and able to
designate the culprit. I cannot say whether or not the person so
employed is regarded as being a sorcerer in the full sense of the word,
or as merely one of the inferior types of magic men above referred to.
Probably he is only the latter, as I do not think there are any
juvenile sorcerers among the Mafulu, and this particular person may be
quite a young boy; indeed, there is in a village near to the Mafulu
Mission Station a young boy who is supposed to have this power. As a
matter of fact this boy is not quite right in his head; but this state
of mind is not among the Mafulu in any way a necessary, or indeed a
usual, qualification for a sorcerer or magic man of any sort. The
person appealed to will perhaps tell them who has done the deed, or
will make some oracular statement which will lead to his
identification. The culprit identified by him will in any case be a
member of another clan, and most probably of another community. When he
has been discovered, there will probably be a fight, in which the
members of the victim&rsquo;s clan, or even, especially if the victim
be a chief or big person, the whole of his community, will join the
injured relatives, this question of suspected causing of death being,
like that of non-repayment of the price paid for a runaway wife, one of
the frequent causes of intercommunity fighting.</p>
<p>Reverting here to the matter of ghosts and spirits, one cannot help
noting a similarity between, on the one hand, the ghostly element of
living food plants and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6434" href=
"#xd26e6434" name="xd26e6434">284</a>]</span>the ghostly element of
human excrement, which constitute the food of the ghosts, and, on the
other hand, the physical inedible remnants of food recently eaten by an
adult victim and the physical excrement and urine of an infant victim,
which are the media used for hostile sorcery through the power of
spirits; though, as regards the latter, I have no evidence of a belief
that the spirits eat them. I tried to get further into this matter, but
was unable to do so. Again one is struck by the fact that the special
<i>gabi</i> tree, which is the tree used for the interment of chiefs
and notables, is one of the trees whose presence is regarded as
indicating a place inhabited by spirits. These elements of similarity
tend, I think, to suggest the possibility of some confusion in the
native mind as to the difference between ghosts and spirits, or of some
originally ghostly origin in what are now regarded as spirits.</p>
<p>The class of magic men who are something less than sorcerers, and
whose powers are perhaps confined to the knowledge of certain specific
forms of incantation, would probably include the person who does the
nose-boring, and perhaps the person who detects the causes of death
above referred to. It would also, I think, include the men who
ascertain the whereabouts of a stolen article and discover the thief,
and who perform the ceremony in connection with hunting, and the
persons who effect, or profess to effect, cures of a more or less
superstitious nature, all of whom are probably not regarded as full
sorcerers.</p>
<p>The professional pig-killer is not, as such, either a sorcerer or a
magic man in the minor sense; and, if <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6443" href="#xd26e6443" name="xd26e6443">285</a>]</span>there has
originally been anything of a superstitious or magic character
associated with him or his functions, I was unable to find any trace of
it, except perhaps as regards the ceremony and incantation in
connection with hunting, which apparently is commonly performed by
him.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Charms.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Mafulu people believe in charms. I have already
referred to those used by young men desirous of marrying. But there are
many other more important charms for various purposes, such as averting
illness and death, success in hunting and fishing, and perhaps
preservation in time of war. These charms may be stones, small pieces
of different sorts of bark, flowers, or various kinds of poisons,
though the poisons appear to be only used for averting illness and
death. They are all procured from sorcerers, who may be of the same or
of some other village, or of another community, and there are sorcerers
who have specialities in certain sorts of charms. These charms are
often carried inside the small charm bags already mentioned.</p>

on a hunting or fishing expedition, and meeting either of these
creatures would probably at once turn back; and I was told that even a

and acts of propitiation, the only examples of them which I was able to
discover were the above-mentioned supplication to the river prior to

with nose-piercing, with hunting, with a dying chief, with the stone
operation for stomach complaints, and with the plant remedies for
wounds, and the acts of propitiation, if such they are, in connection
with ceremonious pig-killing, and especially with the ceremonies
performed at a big feast and at or following a funeral; and as regards
the incantations I could learn nothing as to their nature, nor as to
the specific spiritual powers for the influencing of which they are

and communicative about these things, there will be much more to be
learnt. It may perhaps be that some of the apparently superstitious
acts are, like many such acts performed in England, based upon beliefs
which have long since been forgotten, and have themselves become mere
formalities, to which the natives do not attach serious superstitious
importance; though their fear of ghosts and spirits is undoubtedly a
very real and general one.</p>
<p>There are no secret societies or mysteries, such as are met with in
some of the Solomon Islands, and they have no superstition as to
sneezing.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The subject of taboo may perhaps be referred to under
the present heading, for, though there appear to be no totemic taboos,
and though I have no material showing that the Mafulu taboos are based
on superstitious ideas, it may, I imagine, be assumed that, while some
of these taboos are possibly partly based on medical common sense, the
element of superstition enters more or less into many of them. I have
already referred to a few general restrictions connected with
etiquette, and what I now propose to mention are food taboos.</p>
<p>Young men are not supposed to eat wild pig until <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6481" href="#xd26e6481" name=
"xd26e6481">288</a>]</span>they have married, but this is the only food
restriction which is put upon them.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6483src"
href="#xd26e6483" name="xd26e6483src">10</a> A woman who is about to
give birth to a child must eat no food whatever for a day or rather
longer (never more than two days), before the child is born. I have
already referred to the food taboo on persons undergoing the
nose-piercing operation, and the optional food taboo to which the
nearest relative of a deceased person may submit, in lieu of wearing
the mourning string. There is also a general taboo against any food
other than sweet potato and chewing of betel-nuts, with its condiments
of lime and pepper, upon any male person who intends to take part,
either as a dancer or singer, in any ceremonial dance. This latter term
includes the dance at a big feast and the women&rsquo;s dance on the
eve of it, but not the dancing during the six months&rsquo; interval
before it. It also includes the dance at any of the various minor
ceremonies above described, and at a funeral ceremony. The period of
restriction in the case of the big feast begins when the formal
croton-leaf invitation has gone out to the guests, about a month before
the date of the feast. In the case of a funeral it is necessarily only
quite short, and in cases of other ceremonies it varies, being largely
dependent on the length of period during which the approach of the
ceremony is known. During the period of restriction the people avail
themselves largely of the privilege of betel-chewing, and prior to a
big feast their mouths get very red. In connection with personal
ceremonies upon assumption of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6486" href="#xd26e6486" name="xd26e6486">289</a>]</span>perineal
band, admission to the <i>emone</i> (excepting, as regards this, the
case of a child of very tender years), qualifying for drumming and
dancing, devolution of chieftainship and nose-piercing, the person
concerned, male or female, is under the same food restriction for a day
prior to that of the ceremony, and as regards nose-piercing this taboo
is prior to the actual piercing, and is quite distinct from the
subsequent taboo already referred to. There does not appear to be any
taboo connected with fishing, hunting or war.</p>
<p>The observance of all these taboos is secured only by superstitious
belief or public opinion, or both, there being no method of enforcing
them by punishment or by any exercise of authority by the chiefs.

rather a specially powerful, but perhaps semi-human, spiritual
individual, who, though not having originally created mankind and the
animal and vegetable world and the objects and forces of nature as a

of cocoanuts and other trees and firewood, and as part of the
protective sign for new gardens. The use of the wisp by the Mafulu
people, as above described, is not a taboo used for the protection of
an object from human interference, being intended to protect the
travellers in some way from the spirit or spirits haunting the spot.
But there is, I think, an underlying similarity of superstitious ideas

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Note on the Kuni People</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Father Egedi, who has studied the Kuni people, and has
written a series of articles about them in numbers of <i>Anthropos</i>,
told me that he regarded them as being a cross between the
Papuan-speaking Mafulu and the Melanesian-speaking Papuo-Melanesians of
Mekeo and the adjoining coast. Whether or not this is absolutely and
strictly correct is a question upon which I will not venture to express
an opinion.</p>
<p>In general physique and appearance the Kuni are distinctly and
strongly of the type of the Mafulu, whilst their language is
Melanesian; and, as regards other matters, they in some respects
resemble and in other respects differ from the Mafulu.</p>
<p>As regards physique, Father Egedi distinguishes the Kuni from the
natives of the adjoining coast by their slighter development, slender
limbs and darker colour of skin, in which respects they resemble the
Mafulu; but he regards them as being lower-statured than the tribes of
the interior, which term includes the Mafulu,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6506src" href="#xd26e6506" name="xd26e6506src">1</a> <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6512" href="#xd26e6512" name=
"xd26e6512">291</a>]</span>with greater regularity of features, and of
lighter colour, all of which tallies, I think, with my own observation
of them. But the fact that they are shorter in stature than the Mafulu,
who are themselves shorter than the coast natives, is perhaps a matter
for surprise, if they are a cross between the two. I have not measured
any Kuni heads; but I should be disposed from general observation to
say that they are very similar to those of the Mafulu, being
predominantly mesaticephalic, with tendencies to
brachycephalism.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6514src" href="#xd26e6514"
name="xd26e6514src">2</a></p>
<p>Many of the Lapeka people, who are Kuni, but are on the borders of
the Upper Mekeo district, seemed to me to have distinctly flattish
faces, with remarkably delicately cut features&mdash;some of the women
in particular being exceedingly pretty in profile&mdash;and very bright
sparkling eyes. Where these local characteristics came from I cannot
say, as it could hardly be the result of an intermixture of Mekeo
blood.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6522src" href="#xd26e6522" name=
"xd26e6522src">3</a></p>
<p>The oblique eye, which is occasionally found on the coast,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6527src" href="#xd26e6527" name="xd26e6527src">4</a>
but which I never saw in Mafulu, is, according to Father Egedi,
present, though only rare, among the Kuni. His large amount of
opportunity for observation, and his known care and ability in this
respect, compel me to assume his accuracy; but I can say that I saw a
good many of these eyes among them, and indeed once, having about
twenty of these Kuni <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6533" href=
"#xd26e6533" name="xd26e6533">292</a>]</span>people squatting in front
of me, I observed that about half of them had distinctly oblique
eyes.</p>
<p>Father Egedi speaks of their hair as being &ldquo;generally black,
rarely bright, and more rarely chestnut&rdquo;; and as to this, I would
refer to the fact that the predominating colour of hair among the
Mafulu is dark or darkish brown, so that in this respect the Kuni
apparently tend more to the black-haired coast type of native than do
the Mafulu.</p>
<p>Concerning matters other than physique and language, as I only
passed through the Kuni district, and did not attempt serious
ethnological investigation there, I can say but little beyond what I
learn from Father Egedi&rsquo;s articles and a few other sources; and
the material thus available only deals with a few questions.</p>
<p>It would appear from Father Egedi&rsquo;s observations that the
relationship between villages arising from the splitting up into two or
more of an original family village is not so permanent as I believe it
to be among the Mafulu. Dr. Seligmann says<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6541src" href="#xd26e6541" name="xd26e6541src">5</a> that among
the Kuni Father Egedi &ldquo;could find no trace of intermarrying
groups, or groups of clans claiming common descent,&rdquo; which
statement applies to my investigations among the Mafulu. He further
says<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6546src" href="#xd26e6546" name=
"xd26e6546src">6</a> that &ldquo;The Dilava folk&rdquo; (Dilava is a
Kuni village) &ldquo;marry into all the surrounding villages; and when
a death occurs it is the head of the family of the deceased who says
when mourning shall cease&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6550" href="#xd26e6550" name=
"xd26e6550">293</a>]</span>statements of which the former, and I
believe the latter, could hardly be correctly made concerning the
Mafulu. He also refers<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6552src" href=
"#xd26e6552" name="xd26e6552src">7</a> to Kuni war chiefs, an office
which does not exist among the Mafulu, and apparently understands that
the office of these war chiefs is non-hereditary, a statement which
could not be made of any Mafulu chief; and he refers<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e6557src" href="#xd26e6557" name="xd26e6557src">8</a> to a
funeral ceremony which is quite unknown in Mafulu. But his
statement<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6561src" href="#xd26e6561" name=
"xd26e6561src">9</a> that the <i>kufu</i> (club-house) system seems
less developed than in Mekeo would apply very strongly to the
Mafulu.</p>
<p>The Kuni superstitious remedies for illnesses, as described by
Father Egedi, are quite different from those of Mafulu, and their food
restrictions, as enumerated by him, are in some respects substantially
distinct from those of the Mafulu, though some of them are more or less
similar.</p>
<p>According to him Kuni women, though they may not enter the village
<i>kufu</i> or club-house, are allowed upon its platform, which is not
the case with the Mafulu <i>emone</i>; and eldest sons of Kuni
influential people may not enter into the <i>kufu</i> until their
parents have given a specific feast, which custom is apparently not
identical with that of the Mafulu above described by me, and which
applies to all sons of all members of the village, and not merely to
those of influential people.</p>
<p>The Kuni houses differ from those of the Mafulu, being more or less
round or oval in apparent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6584"
href="#xd26e6584" name="xd26e6584">294</a>]</span>shape, even though
the floor is rectangular. Also according to Father Egedi, Kuni
<i>kufu</i> are of several various sorts, and some of them are
constructed in specific ways, and have specific carved and painted
decorations, some of which are imitative of animals and objects held in
veneration; and these different types of club-house, which include one
used only by elderly bachelors and widowers, have specific
names&mdash;all of which is quite different from what is found in
Mafulu. Among these club-houses Father Egedi includes one built at
feast times higher up the ridge, outside the village, for guests&rsquo;
accommodation, which, though apparently somewhat similar in purpose to
the guests&rsquo; houses at a Mafulu feast, differs from them in form.
Indeed, as regards building construction, the only point of strong
similarity between the Kuni and the Mafulu which I can trace is the
long fireplace extending from front to back of the building, which with
the Kuni is apparently very like that of the Mafulu.</p>
<p>Father Egedi&rsquo;s statement as to Kuni cannibalism, that speaking
generally it appears to be confined to the bodies of people killed in
war or in private vendetta, and that, though other cases are recorded,
they are regarded as a violation of a custom and are detested, might be
equally well said of the Mafulu; though I did not actually hear of any
known record there of the other cases mentioned. Again his statement
that the actual killer must not share in the feast holds good with the
Mafulu; but I believe that this idea exists elsewhere also.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6591" href="#xd26e6591" name=
"xd26e6591">295</a>]</span></p>
<p>Concerning the Kuni implements I can only refer to Dr.
Seligmann&rsquo;s statement,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6594src" href=
"#xd26e6594" name="xd26e6594src">10</a> that they do not appear to use
bows and shields&mdash;which, if correct, is a point of difference
between them and the Mafulu&mdash;and to a few other things referred to
by Father Egedi in his articles. From his descriptions I should imagine
that the Kuni pig-bone implements and their bamboo cutting knives are
similar, and that their wooden vegetable dishes are somewhat similar to
those of the Mafulu. But the Kuni have cooking pots (which they get
from the coast), and use forks and spoons and various other implements
and utensils which are not found in Mafulu, and their mode of producing
fire is quite different from the Mafulu mode.</p>
<p>I recognise that the above comparative notes on Kuni culture are
only of a very fragmentary character; but Father Egedi expresses the
general opinion that, though the language of the Kuni people is
Melanesian, their habits and customs &ldquo;may be considered as making
one with those of the Mafulu people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the whole question of Kuni relationship it can, I think, hardly
be doubted that the Kuni have some characteristics which are clearly
those of the Mafulu and other central mountain tribes, and others which
are obviously those of the Papuo-Melanesians of the adjacent plains and
the coast beyond; and the only question seems to be the nature and
origin of the Kuni relationship to these two types of people. It may
be, as suggested by Father Egedi, that they are actually a cross
between these two mixed types; or, if <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6603" href="#xd26e6603" name="xd26e6603">296</a>]</span>the
suggestion in my concluding chapter as to the possible presence in
these Mafulu and other mountain people of Negrito blood be correct, it
may be that the Kuni people are merely another result of the general
Negrito-Papuo-Melanesian intercrossing, in which the Papuan and
Melanesian elements have been more predominant than they have been with
the Mafulu. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6605" href="#xd26e6605"

<h2 class="main">Conclusion</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What is the origin of these Mafulu people, with their
short stature, small and somewhat rounded heads, slight but active
build, sooty brown skin, and frizzly hair, predominantly brown in
colour, and with their comparatively primitive ideas of organisation,
and simple arts and crafts?</p>
<p>The question is one of no mere local interest, as the answer to it
will probably be the answer to a similar question concerning most, and
perhaps all, of the other Papuan-speaking people of the mountainous
interior of the Central District of British New Guinea, and may even be
a key to the past early history of the entire island.</p>
<p>It has, I think, been hitherto believed that all these mountain
people had a mixed Papuan and Melanesian ancestry; but it was
impossible to be among them, as I was, for some time without being
impressed by the difference in appearance between them and the people
of the adjacent coast and plains, and suspecting that, though they had
Papuan and Melanesian blood in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e6615"
href="#xd26e6615" name="xd26e6615">298</a>]</span>their veins, there
was also some third element there. And the name which obtruded itself
upon my mind, whilst in Mafulu, was Negrito.</p>
<p>The dark skin and the comparatively rounded heads, and, I think,
some shortness of stature are found elsewhere in British New Guinea;
though shortness of stature and rounded heads are unusual, and, I
believe, only local, and I do not know whether even the Papuan skin is
ever quite so dark as that of the Mafulu people. But the almost
universal shortness of stature, the comparatively slight, but strong
and active, build and the brown colour of the hair seemed entirely
different from anything that I had ever seen or read of as regards
either the Papuans or the Melanesians; and all of these, coupled with
the tendency to roundness of head, were consistent with a partial
negrito ancestry.</p>
<p>Then on my return to England I learnt that dwarf people had been
found by the recent expedition into Dutch New Guinea organised by the
British Ornithologists&rsquo; Union. Dr. Haddon has expressed the
opinion that these dwarf people and some dwarf people previously found
by Dr. Rudolph Poch in German New Guinea are all negritoes, or
negritoes crossed with Papuans.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6621src"

and physique of the Mafulu people, and who measured and examined the
three skulls which I brought home, wrote to me as follows:&mdash;</p>

From your paper one can form, for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6630" href="#xd26e6630" name="xd26e6630">299</a>]</span>the first
time, a picture of the physical characters of this tribe; but, when I
proceed to assign the tribe to its proper race, I am at once met by
difficulties. In my opinion the short stature, the pigmented skin, and
the small heads inclined to brachycephaly indicate a strong negrito
element, which we know is widely distributed in the far east, and
certainly, as we should expect, occurs in certain districts of New
Guinea. In the three crania there were characters which one could
assign to Papuan, as well as to a Melanesian stock&#8202;&hellip;. A
brown or reddish tinge is seen not infrequently in the hair of
negritoes. You will see that I am inclined to look on the Mafulu as
showing a very considerable degree of negrito blood, and to regard the
more primitive tribes of New Guinea as being of this nature. If that
were so, the Mafulu might be regarded as belonging to the older
population of New Guinea, both Papuan and Melanesian having added
something to their civilisation, as well as their physical
characters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Keith then is inclined to agree with my suggestion concerning
the origin of the Mafulu; and Dr. Haddon, having seen my notes upon
physique, said that he endorsed the views expressed by Dr. Keith. And
if the view suggested be correct as regards the Mafulu or Fuyuge
people, I am prepared to say that from what I have heard of the other
mountain Papuan-speaking people of that part of New Guinea, including
the Oru Lopiku (Kovio), Boboi and Ambo people, I am convinced that it
must be correct as regards them <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e6634" href="#xd26e6634" name="xd26e6634">300</a>]</span>also,
though the relative predominance of the three strains may well vary
with these different people.</p>
<p>I am hardly qualified to enter into the discussion as to the
relationship, if any, existing between the principal hitherto known
dwarf races, the Pygmies of Central Africa, the Semang of the Malay
Peninsula, the Andamanese and the Aetas of the Philippine Islands, or
to deal with the question whether or not all or some of them are to be
grouped together as forming a distinct and related type, or are to be
regarded as unconnected in the sense that each of them is merely a
local variation, sharing a common ancestry with some other taller
negroid race.</p>
<p>As, however, my suggestion of a partial negrito origin of the Mafulu
people necessarily brings me into contact with this wider question, and
the latter is still one upon which opinions differ, I may perhaps
briefly tabulate some of the chief physical characters of the
Andamanese, the Semang, the Aetas, the dwarf people recently found in
Dutch New Guinea and the Mafulu. I think I may omit the African pygmies
from my tables.</p>

<p>I think that the above tables indicate that, though there are
differences, there are elements of similarity between (i) the Mafulu
people, (2) the Dutch New Guinea dwarfs, and (3) one or more of the
Andamanese, Semang and Aetas; but in my comparison of the Mafulu and
the dwarfs of Dutch New Guinea with the other previously known dwarf
races I would specially draw attention to their similarity in shortness
of stature and (as regards most of the Mafulu and a few of the Dutch
New Guinea people) colour of hair; and this impels me to venture to say
a few words on the larger question.</p>
<p>I have searched through much existing literature concerning the
various hitherto discovered dwarf races of the world with reference to
the question whether, even assuming that these people have an original
primary ancestry from which the taller negroid races also are
descended, they must be regarded as having become a related type,
separate and distinct from the latter, as now existing, or whether they
must all be treated as merely separate local variations, each of them
having failed to develop, or retrograded, and in other respects become
different in type from taller negroid races among or near to whom they
are found. And I am struck by the fact that, though the natural
tendency to local variation in stature, shape of head, colour and other
matters is brought forward in support of the latter theory, no one
seems, in connection with the general question, to have noted the fact
that, whilst the hair colour of negroes, Papuans and Melanesians is
black, the hair of all these various dwarf people <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7099" href="#xd26e7099" name=
"xd26e7099">305</a>]</span>seems to be predominantly brown, and that
this variation explanation, if regarded as applying to these dwarf
races separately and independently of one another, involves a
remarkable coinciding double variation (in stature and predominant
colour of hair) exhibited by all these dwarf people as compared with
the taller negroids.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if there has been an original separation of
descendants of common primary ancestors of all the negroid races,
which, through variation, has resulted in two main types, one
predominantly full-sized and always black-haired, and the other always
short and predominantly brown-haired, and the pygmies (negritoes and
negrilloes) are to be regarded as being all descendants of the latter
type, who have since for some reason become geographically separated,
there would appear to be nothing remarkable in the double
variation.</p>
<p>But in that case we are, I take it, justified in regarding the dwarf
races as being a separate type, to be distinguished from the taller
races; and, if that be so, there appears to be substantial ground for
thinking that the Dutch New Guinea dwarf people and the Mafulu people
are in part descended from people of that type.</p>
<p>I may also draw attention (for what they are worth as points of
detail) to the facts already noted, that the Semang and Andamanese, who
bury their ordinary folk under ground, adopt tree burial, and
apparently, as regards the Semang, platform burial not on trees also,
as a more honourable method of disposing of the bodies <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7107" href="#xd26e7107" name=
"xd26e7107">306</a>]</span>of important people and chiefs; and that as
regards these matters the Mafulu custom is similar.</p>
<p>Also the very simple ideas of the Mafulu, as compared with Papuans
and Melanesians, in matters of social organization, implements, arts
and crafts, religion and other things may well, I think, be associated
with a primitive negrito origin.</p>
<p>If the Mafulu people may be properly regarded as having a negrito
ancestry, distinct in type from that of either the Papuans or the
Melanesians, the negrito element would presumably be the earlier one,
Papuan and Melanesian infusion having occurred subsequently. Indeed it
may well be believed that the negrito element is derived from an
original ancestry who were probably the earlier inhabitants of New
Guinea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7113" href="#xd26e7113"

<p>Consonants: <i>k, g; t, d; p, b, f, v; m, n; r, l; s; y</i>.</p>
<p>The vowels are pronounced as in Italian, the consonants as in
English. The sound of the Italian <i>c</i> is also found, but is
rare.</p>
<p>It is sometimes difficult to distinguish between <i>o</i> and
<i>u</i>. Ex. <i lang="xx">ombo(le)</i> or <i lang="xx">umbo(le)</i>,
belly.</p>
<p><i>G, b</i>, and <i>d</i>, are often preceded by a nasal, sometimes
constant (and then marked in the vocabulary), sometimes variable
according to the pronunciation of individuals. For the nasals <i>m</i>
is employed before <i>p</i> and <i>b</i>, and <i>n</i> before other
consonants.</p>
<p>The <i>i</i> and <i>y</i> are very difficult to distinguish,
especially when they follow one another. Ex. <i>iye</i> or <i>ye</i>,
or <i>ie</i>, tree; <i>iangolo</i> or <i>yangolo</i>, ear. Father Egidi
wrote <i>j</i> for <i>y</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>l</i> and <i>r</i> are very difficult to determine. Ex.
<i>aliete</i> or <i>ariete</i>, to salute; <i>naul&rsquo;i</i> and
<i>naur&rsquo;i</i>, my eye. In the vocabulary <i>l</i> is used
generally.</p>
<p>The <i>s</i> is often <i>ts</i>. Ex. tsivu and sivu; su(le) and
tsu(le grass. Also in the future suffix <i>t</i> or <i>ts</i>. Ex.
<i>nati</i> or <i>natsi</i>, I will eat.</p>

<h4 class="main">II. Elision.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A great number of Fuyuge words terminate in an open
syllable of which the vowel is generally <i>e</i>. This <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7268" href="#xd26e7268" name=
"xd26e7268">308</a>]</span>syllable is usually omitted at the end of a
phrase, and nearly always when the following word commences with a
consonant. But if the following word begins with a vowel the final
<i>e</i> only falls away. Thus the complete form of a word is rarely
used, except to avoid confusion, or for the sake of emphasis. The
following are examples:</p>
<p><i lang="xx">ovo(le),</i> pig: <i lang="xx">ovol&rsquo; ovoge,</i>
boar, <i>ovo momombe,</i> sow.</p>
<p><i lang="xx">ifa(ne),</i> beautiful: <i lang="xx">ifa ta,</i> very
fine, <i lang="xx">ifan&rsquo; aka,</i> less fine.</p>
<p><i lang="xx">da(le),</i> who? <i lang="xx">nu da?</i> who art thou?
<i>dal&rsquo; aua?</i> who is this?</p>
<p><i lang="xx">i(nde),</i> to give: <i>ne i,</i> give me, <i>ne
ind&rsquo; u,</i> give it to me.</p>
<p><i lang="xx">-a(le)</i>, with: <i lang="xx">andal&rsquo; a?</i> with
what? <i lang="xx">indiv&rsquo; al&rsquo; ongai</i>, cut with the
knife.</p>
<p><i lang="xx">a(le),</i> here: <i lang="xx">a mo ma?</i> must I put
it here? <i lang="xx">al&rsquo; itatsi,</i> he will sleep here.</p>
<p><i lang="xx">u(ne),</i> and: <i lang="xx">kitoval&rsquo; u kene,</i>
black parroquet and white, <i lang="xx">amb&rsquo; un&rsquo; ale,</i>
banana and sugar cane.</p>
<p>Note (1). The <i>b</i> in an elision sometimes changes to <i>p.</i>
Ex. <i lang="xx">obe,</i> bud, <i lang="xx">op&rsquo;indie,</i> to
bud.</p>
<p>(2). Sometimes two syllables are elided: Ex. <i lang="xx">taume,
tame,</i> from which comes <i lang="xx">ovo ta,</i> a tame pig, and
<i lang="xx">ovo taum&rsquo; ifa,</i> the tame pig is good.</p>
<p>(3). Words which do not end in <i>e,</i> rarely elide a final vowel,
and never the last syllable. Ex. <i lang="xx">kuku,</i> tobacco,
<i lang="xx">kuk&rsquo; oko nei,</i> give me a little tobacco; <i lang=
"xx">na,</i> I, <i lang="xx">nu,</i> thee, <i lang="xx">ongo</i> at the
foot of, <i lang="xx">na n&rsquo; ong&rsquo; ando,</i> I am at thy
feet; <i lang="xx">umbubi, wash, umbub&rsquo; u,</i> wash him.</p>
<p>(4). Some verbs in <i>-ri</i> or <i>-li</i> however often omit this
syllable. Ex. <i>ivo(ri)</i> to wipe, <i>na ga kodig&rsquo; ivo,</i> I
have wiped the plates; <i>tsimi(li),</i> to lick, <i>ama tsimi,</i>
lick the salt; <i>itu(lili)</i> to split, <i>ol&rsquo; itu,</i> split
the wood.</p>
<p>In the grammar and vocabulary the syllable which may be elided is
enclosed in a bracket, and in compound words and phrases the elision is
marked with an apostrophe, as in the preceding examples.</p>

<p>2. An initial <i>o,</i> on the other hand, sometimes changes to

<p class="first">There is no modification or grammatical difference to
mark gender.</p>
<p>Sex is indicated by separate words in the case of human beings:
<i lang="xx">an(e)</i> man, <i lang="xx">me(le)</i> boy, <i lang=
"xx">ena(ne)</i> brother, <i lang="xx">amu(le)</i> woman, <i lang=
"xx">ame(le)</i> girl, <i lang="xx">eta(de)</i> sister.</p>
<p>For mammals the words <i lang="xx">avoge,</i> male, or <i lang=
"xx">momobe,</i> female, follow the noun: <i lang="xx">ovol&rsquo;
avoge,</i> boar, <i lang="xx">ovo&rsquo; momobe,</i> sow.</p>
<p>Dr. Strong notes that the sex of birds is sometimes denoted by the
adjective <i lang="xx">ifa(ne),</i> good, <i>i.e.,</i>
&ldquo;ornamented,&rdquo; for the male bird, and <i lang=
"xx">ifan&rsquo; ul&rsquo; amu,</i> the &ldquo;wife of the
ornamented&rdquo; for the female: <i lang="xx">uruv&rsquo; ifa,</i> the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Only nouns indicating persons have been found with
plurals. These are formed by changing the final <i>e</i> to <i>i.</i>
Sometimes the <i>e</i> is changed to <i>a;</i> this may indicate the
dual.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">amu(le)</i> woman, plur. amuli and amula;
<i>so(le),</i> young man, plur. <i lang="xx">soli</i> and <i lang=
"xx">sola; me(le),</i> child, plur. <i lang="xx">meli</i> and <i lang=
"xx">mela.</i></p>
<p>Note (1). The word <i lang="xx">a(ne)</i> man, has a double plural
in two different meanings: <i lang="xx">ani,</i> the men; <i lang=
"xx">ake(da)</i> the married men.</p>
<p>(2). The shortened form of the word is often used in the plural.
This naturally is the same as the singular.</p>

<h4 class="main">III. Case.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. There is no modification of the noun to express
case, but the equivalents of cases are shown by suffixes. The vocative
alone often takes a final <i>a</i> as in the interrogative form.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">Tayova, a tsia!</i> Tayo, come here!</p>
<p>The subject, direct object, and indirect object are however easily
recognised by their position in the sentence. The subject comes first,
followed by the direct object, then the indirect object if there be
one, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7612" href="#xd26e7612" name=
"xd26e7612">310</a>]</span>with the verb at the end. If there are
complements they immediately precede the word which governs them.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">naga kuku nu inde,</i> I tobacco to thee gave;
<i lang="xx">Baiv&rsquo; u mega nembe u fod&rsquo; al&rsquo; ema,</i>
Baiva&rsquo;s child bird his bow-with killed; <i lang="xx">nuni ake mu
letsi gatsi,</i> thou men their village-to will-go.</p>
<p>2. The genitive is expressed by means of the possessive
adjective.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">ovo&rsquo;u ma,</i> hair of the pig, lit. pig his
hair.</p>
<p>3. Persons belonging to a place sometimes omit the adjective.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">A Kotsi,</i> a man of Kotsi; <i lang=
"xx">An&rsquo;Alol&rsquo;,</i> a man of Alole; <i lang="xx">Alol&rsquo;
amu,</i> a woman of Alole; <i lang="xx">Ambov&rsquo;amu,</i> a woman of
Ambove; <i lang="xx">Tseluku ul&rsquo; akeda,</i> men of Tseluku.</p>
<p>4. Position in a place, or motion to or from a place is shown in the
following ways. When the noun has a shortened for <i lang="xx">-tsi</i>
is suffixed. If there is no short form the final <i>e</i> of the noun
is changed to <i>i</i> and <i lang="xx">-tsi</i> is added.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">nani etsi ando,</i> I am in the house; <i lang=
"xx">nuni bulitsi gatsi,</i> thou wilt go to the garden; <i lang=
"xx">naga Mambutsi l&rsquo;a tela,</i> I have come here from Mambo.</p>
<p>Note (1). Some proper names of places do not take the suffix
<i lang="xx">-tsi.</i> Ex. <i lang="xx">amul&rsquo; Alol&rsquo;
itatsi,</i> the woman will sleep at Alole.</p>
<p>(2). Other proper names, especially those of mountains and the
villages built on them, take the suffix <i lang="xx">-tu</i> (upon)
instead of <i lang="xx">-tsi.</i> Ex. <i lang="xx">Falitu gatsi,</i> I
will go to Faliba, lit. I will go upon Faliba.</p>

interrogative. If the noun ends in <i>e,</i> this vowel is changed to
<i>a.</i> If already ending in <i>a,</i> the <i>a</i> takes a strong

Case, Interrogative and Demonstrative forms they are the same as
Nouns.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">a baibe, amu baibe,</i> man tall, woman tall;
<i lang="xx">uli baibitsi mau,</i> pot big-in put it, put it in the big
pot; <i>ifana?</i> is it good? <i lang="xx">ifan&rsquo; ala,</i> it is
good.</p>
<div class="div3 subsection">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">II. Adjectives of Quality.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. Number.</p>
<p>Number is expressed as with nouns by changing <i>e</i> to <i>i.</i>
Some adjectives in <i>-a</i> add <i>i.</i> There are no adjectives with
the plural in <i>-a.</i> Some adjectives in <i>-a(ne)</i> have the
plural <i>-ai.</i></p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">kakava(ne)</i> strong, plur. <i lang="xx">kakavani;
safa(le),</i> plur. <i lang="xx">safa(li); isosonga,</i> idle, plur.
<i lang="xx">isosongai; aka(ne)</i> small, plur. <i>akai.</i></p>
<p>2. Agreement.</p>
<p>The adjective always follows the noun which it qualifies, and takes
the suffix of the noun.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">a sesada,</i> fence long; <i lang="xx">emo gai,</i>
house old; <i lang="xx">kodige kisiakatsi,</i> plate little-in:
<i lang="xx">indiv&rsquo; amoja(le)</i> knife blunt-with; <i lang=
"xx">koua baibitu,</i> box big-on.</p>
<p>Sometimes the pronoun <i lang="xx">u(ne),</i> his, is placed between
the noun and the adjective.</p>
<p>The meaning of this is uncertain, but it appears to be more
emphatic, as <i>e.g.</i> &ldquo;the road which is good,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the house which is bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ex, <i lang="xx">enamb&rsquo; un&rsquo; ifa,</i> the good road,
<i lang="xx">em&rsquo; u koi,</i> the bad house. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e7882" href="#xd26e7882" name=
"xd26e7882">312</a>]</span></p>
<p>The adjective used as predicate immediately follows the noun,
without a substantive verb.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">an&rsquo; ala gududuba,</i> that man (is) stingy;
<i>nuni sesada,</i> thou (art) tall; <i lang="xx">amu safali,</i> the
women (are) weak.</p>
<p>Note.&mdash;When the subject is represented by a pronoun of the
first or second person dual or plural, the predicate remains
singular.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">dini kakava(ne)</i> we (are) strong; <i lang=
"xx">yani kapape,</i> you two (are) weak; but, <i lang="xx">muni
isosongai,</i> they (are) idle.</p>
<p>When the predicate expresses a negation the word expressing the
quality is followed by the adverb <i lang="xx">ua(ne)</i> not.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">sesad&rsquo; ua, onov&rsquo; aka,</i> it is not
long, it is short.</p>
<p>3. Comparison.</p>
<p>There is no special form for comparisons. Two positive statements
are made, or a superlative may be used.</p>
<p>Ex. My house is larger than yours may be translated: <i lang=
"xx">naul&rsquo; e baibe, nul&rsquo; a kisiaka,</i> my house is large,
yours is small, or <i lang="xx">nul&rsquo;e baibe, naul&rsquo;a baibe
ta,</i> your house is large, mine is large much.</p>
<p>Equality is expressed by the suffix <i lang="xx">-umba</i> or
<i lang="xx">-yakala.</i></p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">naul&rsquo; e, nul&rsquo; em&rsquo; umba,</i> my
house is like your house; <i lang="xx">nuni sesada, nauyekala,</i> you
are tall like me.</p>
<p>A superlative is expressed by the prefix <i lang="xx">ande,</i> or
the suffix <i lang="xx">-ta.</i> But if the adjective in the
superlative expresses a lessening of the quality then <i lang=
"xx">-aka(ne)</i> is suffixed.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">baibe,</i> large, <i lang="xx">ande baibe,</i>
larger; <i lang="xx">ifa,</i> fine, <i>ifata,</i> finer; but <i lang=
"xx">ono(ve),</i> short, <i lang="xx">onov&rsquo;aka,</i> shorter.</p>
<p>The prefix <i lang="xx">ande</i> is used only with adjectives which
express an idea of extension.</p>
<p>When the adjective expresses an actual state rather than a passive,
it is preceded by the sign of past tense, the particle <i>ga.</i></p>
<p>Ex. <i>ant g&rsquo;ifa,</i> the breeches are (have become) good;
<i>ena ga ko,</i> the road (is) bad. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>1. The first form <i lang="xx">na, nu, u(ne)</i> etc., is used
either as subject or object of the verb, the meaning being only
indicated by the position of the word.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">na kuku nu inditsi,</i> I will give thee tobacco;
<i lang="xx">na un&rsquo; adatsi,</i> I will strike him; <i lang=
"xx">ya di ong&rsquo; ando,</i> you two are beside us.</p>
<p>When used before the imperative of the verb <i lang="xx">indi,</i>
to give, <i lang="xx">na</i> becomes <i lang="xx">ne.</i></p>
<p>Ex. <i>ne i, ne inde,</i> give me.</p>
<p><span class="corr" id="xd26e8321" title="Not in source">2.</span>
The forms <i lang="xx">nave</i> and <i lang="xx">ove</i> are rarely
used. The commonest use is with the words <i>ete,</i> to say,
<i>ende,</i> also.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">nav&rsquo; elete,</i> I said; <i lang=
"xx">ov&rsquo; elete,</i> he said; <i lang="xx">nav&rsquo; ende,
nov&rsquo; ende, ov&rsquo; ende,</i> I also, thou also, he also.</p>
<p>3. The forms <i lang="xx">nani, nuni,</i> etc., are employed when
the verb is understood, or to indicate opposition or emphasis.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">da gatsi? dini;</i> who will go? we (will);
<i lang="xx">nuni kakape ta, nani kakava,</i> you are weak, but I am
strong; <i lang="xx">nani a baibe,</i> I am a great man.</p>
<p>4. The dual is generally observed by the natives. Adjectives used
with the dual pronoun take the singular form.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">dani sosonga,</i> we (are) idle, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e8371" href="#xd26e8371" name=
"xd26e8371">315</a>]</span></p>
<p>5. The dual is often employed with two subjects one of which is
plural.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">Kakao tu, tsimani u g&rsquo;anga</i>, Kakao they
two, with the policemen, have started.</p>
<p>When <i lang="xx">dani</i> is used alone it is generally inclusive
of the person addressed, and means &ldquo;I and thou.&rdquo; If the
third person is intended the name is used: <i lang="xx">dani
Okomi&rsquo; u da gatsi</i>, we two Okomi with we will go. <i lang=
"xx">Yani</i> is used in a similar way, when one of the persons
referred to is not present: <i lang="xx">ya, Dun&rsquo;u yani
natsi</i>, you two Dune with you will go. The use of the conjunction
<i lang="xx">u(ne)</i> with the second member of the subject does not
appear to be constant.</p>
<p>6. The pronoun of the third person singular <i lang="xx">u(ne)</i>
when it is the direct object of the verb usually follows, and often
takes the form -<i lang="xx">unde</i>.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">kodigitsi mau</i>, put it in the dish; <i lang=
"xx">nag&rsquo; al&rsquo; unde</i>, I have seen him.</p>

<p>The suffix -<i lang="xx">mule</i>, is equivalent to self, <i lang=

<p>These adjectives precede the noun which they govern. With personal
nouns the forms <i>naula</i>, etc., are sometimes used.</p>
<p>Ex. <i>nau me</i> and <i>naula me</i>, my son; <i>diu vase</i> and
<i>diula vase</i>, our guest.</p>
<p>Note.&mdash;The form <i>nulu</i> is heard in the phrase <i>nulu
babe</i>, thy father.</p>
<p>The suffix <i>mule</i> is also used in the sense of
&ldquo;own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ex. <i>numul&rsquo; ul&rsquo; i to, n&rsquo; alo</i>, your own name,
which I know; <i>namul&rsquo; ul i</i>, my own name. These suggest that
the true possessive is simply <i>ul</i>(<i>e</i>) or
<i>ula</i>(<i>ne</i>).</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The particle <i lang="xx">ga</i> (often <i lang=
"xx">g&rsquo;</i> before a vowel) is generally used with the past
tense, and is rarely absent in the positive form of the verb. But it
may be used also with the present and future. With the present it seems
to indicate reference to a preceding action in the sense of
&ldquo;being on the point of,&rdquo; &ldquo;ready to.&rdquo; With the
future it has almost the sense of &ldquo;go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">Ake ga nembe na,</i> the men have eaten the bird;

<p>Note (1). <i lang="xx">Ga</i> always immediately follows the
subject, except with the past of the verb <i lang="xx">ange(ge),</i> to
go, which always has <i lang="xx">g&rsquo;anga.</i></p>
<p>(2). When the subject is not a pronoun, the pronoun of the 3rd pers.
sing. is often expressed.</p>

<p>3. <i>Notes on the foregoing paradigms.</i></p>
<p><i>a.</i> Indicative present.</p>
<p>Most verbs double the last syllable of the stem, which in the first
conjugation always ends in <i lang="xx">e</i>. There are, however, some
exceptions, especially among verbs in <i lang="xx">i</i>, and those
which have a verbal suffix. The syllable <i lang="xx">-te</i> when
doubled is always <i lang="xx">-tede</i>.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">Nag alili</i>, I see; <i lang="xx">nani e gadi</i>,
I build (tie up) the house; <i lang="xx">nani okid&rsquo; atede</i>, I
light the fire.</p>
<p><i>b.</i> Indicative past.</p>
<p>The difference between the two forms, both of which are preceded by
the particle <i lang="xx">ga</i>, is not yet clearly made out. The
ending <i>e</i> seems to refer to the time when the action finished,
whilst <i>-a</i> has a more general signification.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">Naga ne</i>, I have eaten, <i lang="xx">naga kupa
na</i>, I ate the potatoes. There is another form which replaces the
final syllable of the present tense by <i>-ua</i>. Verbs in <i>-i</i>
add <i>-ua</i> to the final syllable. But it is uncertain whether this
expresses the near past, or includes an idea of movement.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">na bul&rsquo; elelua</i>, I have just worked in the
garden; <i lang="xx">nu a gadi ua</i>, you have just tied up the fence.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e9280" href="#xd26e9280" name=
"xd26e9280">319</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>c</i>. Indicative future.</p>
<p>If the syllables preceding the suffix <i lang="xx">-tsi</i> also
contain <i lang="xx">-tsi-ti</i>. In monosyllabic verbs especially, a
second form of the future is often found, which retains the doubling of
the present tense.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">etsiati</i>, will come; <i lang="xx">nenetsi</i>,
will eat; <i lang="xx">yeyetsi</i>, will take. For <i lang="xx">ga</i>
with the future, see below.</p>
<p><i>d</i>. Imperative.</p>
<p>The first form of the imperative has less force than the second. In
the first conjugation the second form always terminates in <i lang=
"xx">-au</i>, even when the first form is irregular. The last syllable
of the imperative is often lost, especially when the ending is <i lang=
"xx">-li</i>.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">aitodede</i>, runs, imperat. <i lang=
"xx">aitode</i> and <i lang="xx">aitodau</i>; <i lang="xx">itulili</i>,
ward off, imperat. <i lang="xx">itu</i>; <i lang="xx">bole</i>, leaves,
imperat. <i lang="xx">bole</i>, <i lang="xx">bo</i>, and <i lang=
"xx">bolau</i>; <i lang="xx">ameme</i>, puts, imperat. <i lang=
"xx">a</i> and <i lang="xx">ama</i>.</p>
<p>The imperative is only used for the second person. In the first and
third (sometimes even in the second) it is replaced by the
subjunctive.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">di ango</i>, let us go; <i lang="xx">to
n&rsquo;alo</i>, speak, that I may know; <i lang="xx">go di go</i>, go
that we may go.</p>
<p><i>e</i>. Subjunctive.</p>
<p>The two forms of the subjunctive are distinguished only in
composition, and have not yet been clearly understood. The last
syllable besides is rarely heard except in questions, and refers then
to the interrogative form. The subjunctive without a conjunction is
used in simple phrases consisting only of subject and object.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">kuku gadi, di no</i>, roll the tobacco (make
cigarette), that we may smoke (eat).</p>
<p><i>f</i>. Infinitive.</p>
<p>The forms given as infinitive are uncertain. They may be verbal
nouns. They are used in phrases such as: <i lang="xx">nam&rsquo; u
babe</i>, father of eating, for &rsquo;a great eater&rsquo;: <i lang=
"xx">tsimilim&rsquo; u babe</i>, father of licking, cf. <i lang=
"xx">andaval&rsquo; u babe</i>, father of crying, one who causes
crying.</p>
<p><i>g</i>. Past Participle.</p>
<p>This does not easily lose the final syllable when it ends a
sentence. In other cases, when it is followed by the word it qualifies
it loses <i lang="xx">-ane</i>, if the qualified word begins with a
vowel, and <i lang="xx">-ne</i> in other cases.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">iy&rsquo; ongaimane</i>, the cut tree, <i lang=
"xx">indiv&rsquo; ongaima ya</i>, or <i lang="xx">ongaim&rsquo;
indi&rsquo; ya</i>, take the broken knife, <i lang=
"xx">g&rsquo;usangaman&rsquo; ul&rsquo; ande</i>, the thing of
death.</p>
<p>The past participle of some verbs has not yet been ascertained.</p>
<p><i>h</i>. Verbal Adjectives.</p>
<p>The exact difference between the two forms is not accurately
ascertained. The first seems to indicate an instrument, and is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e9433" href="#xd26e9433" name=
"xd26e9433">320</a>]</span>equivalent to the phrase &ldquo;used
for,&rdquo; the second appears to indicate habitual rather than
momentary use. When qualifying persons <i lang="xx">-onde</i> is used
for <i lang="xx">-ondana</i>.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">indi kupa fifitabula</i>, knife for scraping
potatoes; <i>ai safatsilibula</i>, a yam which has rotted; <i lang=
"xx">kulule iy&rsquo; adedondona</i>, a hammer for striking wood;
<i lang="xx">nuni oyatonde</i>, you are only joking; <i lang="xx">nani
falawa me nonde</i>, I don&rsquo;t eat bread.</p>
<p>In composition <i lang="xx">-ande</i>, or at least <i lang=
"xx">-nde</i>, is lost when the word qualified follows.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">ai filibulanda</i>, a yam for planting, <i lang=
"xx">filibula&rsquo; ai ne i</i>, give me the yam for planting;
<i lang="xx">ambe nenondana</i>, the eatable banana, <i lang=
"xx">nenond&rsquo; ambe ya</i>, take the eatable banana.</p>

<div class="div3 subsection">
<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">V. Negation.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The negative of the verb is formed by the particle
<i>me</i> or <i>mi</i> preceding. In the imperative it also precedes,
but when emphasis is laid upon the negation <i>mi</i> follows. The
difference between <i>me</i> and <i>mi</i> is not clear, but <i>me</i>
appears to be used only before verbs beginning with a consonant, and
<i>mi</i> with other verbs.</p>
<p>A negative participle or infinitive does not appear. For the verbal
adjective the suffix <i lang="xx">-ua(ne)</i> is used.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">Na mi alele</i>, I do not understand; <i lang=
"xx">nani matsine mi engatsi</i>, I will not put on the (shell)
bracelet; <i lang="xx">mi unde</i>, do not fear; <i lang="xx">kolose
mi</i>, do not play; <i lang="xx">me ya</i>, do not take; <i lang=

<p>The present in the first conjugation keeps the reduplication of the
stem, and changes the final <i>e</i> to <i>-oma</i>. The second
conjugation simply adds <i>-ma</i>. The interrogative in the past
simply changes the <i>e</i> of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e9607"
href="#xd26e9607" name="xd26e9607">321</a>]</span>the positive
indicative to <i>a</i> in both forms. The future is formed in the same
way from the subjunctive with a stress upon the final <i>a</i> in the
first conjugation.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">Nuga malele yera?</i> have you taken the book?
<i lang="xx">uga nemb&rsquo; emama?</i> has he killed the bird?
<i lang="xx">nu aiti gol&agrave;?</i> would you start to-morrow?
<i lang="xx">kupa g&rsquo;ilama?</i> are the potatoes cooked?</p>
<p>Note (1). The future interrogative replies to the question,
&ldquo;Can I&#8202;&hellip;&rdquo;? or &ldquo;Should
I&#8202;&hellip;&rdquo;?</p>
<p>(2). The interrogative of the near past (<i>cf.</i> p. 318, 3,
<i>b</i>) is formed by substituting <i lang="xx">-una</i> for <i lang=
"xx">-ua</i>.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">nug&rsquo; em&rsquo; aliluna?</i> Have you just
come to see the village?</p>
<p>(3). The form of the second future as <i lang="xx">umbibia</i> is
rarely heard, except with the verb <i lang="xx">alili</i>, see, from
which comes <i lang="xx">&rsquo;Aria?</i> see?</p>
<p>(4). The negative interrogative is formed like the simple negative
by <i lang="xx">me</i> or <i lang="xx">mi</i> preceding the verb.</p>
<p>The questions &ldquo;What should I do?&rdquo; &ldquo;What should I
say,&rdquo; How should I begin it?&rdquo; are translated by the
expression <i lang="xx">do(le)&hellip; maiti</i>, from <i lang=
"xx">do(le)?</i> where?</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">dotamaiti?</i> how should I say? <i lang=
"xx">dol&rsquo; imaiti?</i> what should I do? <i lang="xx">do yela
maiti?</i> how shall I call?</p>

<h4 class="main">VII. Substantive Verb.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. In the present tense there is no substantive verb.
The predicate and subject are combined as in the examples already given
(cf. p. 312, 2). But when the present indicates a state in opposition
to one preceding it, <i lang="xx">ga</i> is used before the adjective,
or if in opposition to a future state, the verb <i lang="xx">ando</i>
follows.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">Kuku ga ko</i>, the tobacco is bad; <i lang=
"xx">balava ga ua</i>, the bread is finished; <i>indi ga kouatu</i>,
the knife is on the box; <i lang="xx">ambe g&rsquo;ifa</i>, the banana
is good; <i lang="xx">ambe gos&rsquo; ando</i>, the banana is (still)
green (not ripe).</p>
<p>The past is more difficult to express. It always requires an adverb
of time.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">Mele maleke ifa, audati ga ko</i>, the child
formerly was good, now he is bad.</p>
<p>3. For other tenses the verb is translated only by the auxiliaries
<i lang="xx">-elele</i> and <i lang="xx">-angege</i>, for which cf. p.
322, 7. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e9732" href="#xd26e9732"

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">VIII. Auxiliary Verbs.</h4>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. The particle <i lang="xx">ga</i> may be used to
make any expression whatever attributive.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">Yu g&rsquo;ua</i>, the water is finished
(<i>i.e</i>., is not); <i lang="xx">malele ga kouatsi</i>, the book is
in the box.</p>
<p>In such examples there is almost the sense of a past action, as if
it were &ldquo;The water (has become) nothing,&rdquo; &ldquo;the book
has been put (is already in) the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2. The verbs <i lang="xx">ete, tede</i>, to say, or to do, and
<i lang="xx">elele</i>, to become, are often used to form a noun stem
into a verb. <i lang="xx">Ete</i> and <i lang="xx">tede</i> give the
sense of <i>sounding</i>, <i lang="xx">elele</i> gives the sense of
<i>using</i> whatever the noun expresses.</p>
<p>Ex.</p>
<p><i lang="xx">fioli</i>, flute, <i lang="xx">fioliete</i>, to play
the flute.<br>
<i lang="xx">yuve</i>, water, <i lang="xx">yuv&rsquo; elele</i>, to

<p>4. The negative is formed regularly by <i>mi</i>.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">nani yu mi elatsi</i>, I shall not bathe; <i lang=
"xx">degu mi e</i>, don&rsquo;t get dirty.</p>
<p>5. The interrogative is regular.</p>
<p>Pres. or past, <i lang="xx">tena?</i> or <i lang="xx">tama?
elena?</i> or <i>elama?</i> Fut. <i lang="xx">toma?</i> and <i lang=
"xx">tola? eloma?</i> and <i lang="xx">elola?</i></p>
<p>6. The auxiliaries <i lang="xx">ete, tede, elele</i>, should be
distinguished from the regular verb, <i lang="xx">tede</i> or
<i>ta</i>, to make. The latter is a distinct verb used when the result
of the action is to produce a new thing.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">Sambari tatsi</i>, will make a wall; <i lang=
"xx">ombo tatsi</i>, will make a sieve.</p>
<p>7. The verbs <i lang="xx">elele</i> and <i lang="xx">angege</i>,
both meaning &ldquo;to become,&rdquo; may be regarded as auxiliary
verbs when they are used with adjectives, often taking the place of a
substantive verb. In this use <i>elele</i> is never, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e9981" href="#xd26e9981" name=
"xd26e9981">323</a>]</span><i lang="xx">angege</i> very rarely used in
the past tense, the particle <i lang="xx">ga</i> taking their
place.</p>
<p>Both are regular except in the imperative, which has respectively
<i>ela</i> and <i>elau</i>, <i>ange</i> and <i>angau</i>.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">Ifan&rsquo; eloma?</i> will he become handsome?
<i lang="xx">ifa mi elatsi?</i> he will not be handsome? <i lang=
"xx">indi g&rsquo; ifa</i>, the knife is good; <i lang="xx">yuv&rsquo;
uan angatsi</i>, the water will cease (become nothing); <i lang=
"xx">mel g&rsquo; us&rsquo; anga</i>, or <i lang="xx">me g&rsquo;
use</i>, the child is dead.</p>

<h4 class="main">IX. Verbal Suffixes.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. The suffix <i lang="xx">-i</i>, added to a noun
stem, forms generally a neuter verb.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">abe</i>, work, <i lang="xx">abi</i>, to work;
<i lang="xx">iso</i>(<i lang="xx">ne</i>), smoke, <i lang=
"xx">isoni</i>, to give forth smoke; <i lang="xx">kese</i>, a clean
vegetable, <i lang="xx">kesi</i>, to clean vegetables.</p>
<p>2. The suffix <i lang="xx">-tede</i>, added to a noun stem, forms
usually an active verb.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">foye</i>, ashes, <i lang="xx">foitede</i>, to cook
in ashes; <i lang="xx">gurube</i>, neck, <i lang="xx">gurutede</i>, to
hang at the neck.</p>
<p>3. The suffix of manner defining the verb, is formed by adding the
adjective with the final syllable changed to <i>-i</i>.</p>
<p>Note (1). The suffix of manner is always added to the infinitive
form of the preceding verb.</p>
<p>(2). In the negative these compound verbs are considered a single
word.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">te</i>, say, <i lang="xx">ifane</i>, good, <i lang=
"xx">tam&rsquo; ifani</i>, to say well. <i lang="xx">i</i>, do,
<i lang="xx">koye</i>, bad, <i lang="xx">i&rsquo;koi</i>, to do badly.
<i lang="xx">ilele</i>, cook, <i lang="xx">akane</i>, small, <i lang=
"xx">ilam&rsquo;akani</i>, to half-cook.</p>
<p>4. The suffix <i lang="xx">-matede</i> appears to have a causative
signification.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">ga koda</i> (perhaps the past of <i lang=
"xx">kodede</i>,) pierced, <i>komatede</i>, to pierce (of a man);
<i lang="xx">ga siuda</i>, extinguished, <i lang="xx">siumatede</i>, to
extinguish.</p>
<p>Note. This suffix appears in some examples as a separate verb in the
same sense.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">yuv&rsquo; olola mata</i>, warm up the water;
<i lang="xx">indi koi matatsi</i>, the knife will become bad.</p>
<p>The negative is not known.</p>
<p>5. The suffixes <i lang="xx">-meme</i> and <i lang="xx">-ngo</i> are
added to neuter <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e10156" href=
"#xd26e10156" name="xd26e10156">324</a>]</span>verbs. The first has an
active meaning, the second is passive.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">yu</i>, to be upright, <i lang="xx">yuma</i>, to
put upright, <i lang="xx">yungo</i>, to be upright. <i lang=
"xx">yari</i>(?), <i lang="xx">yarima</i>, to hang, <i lang=
"xx">yaringo</i>, to be hanging.</p>
<p>Note (1). <i lang="xx">Meme</i> is regularly conjugated; <i lang=
"xx">-ngo</i> is imperfectly known.</p>
<p>(2). Negative forms are <i lang="xx">me yumatsi</i>, will not place
upright, <i lang="xx">mi yaringo</i>, not hanging.</p>
<p>6. The auxiliary verbs, except <i lang="xx">ga</i>, may perhaps be
included among the suffixes (<i>see</i> p. 322, VIII.).</p>

<p>Note (1). The verbs <i lang="xx">ando</i> and <i lang="xx">ito</i>
are not yet accurately understood.</p>
<p>(2). The verb <i lang="xx">ete</i> has a double conjugation, the
initial <i lang="xx">e</i> being retained or omitted at will. The past
<i lang="xx">elete</i> is used in reporting the words of another
person.</p>
<p>(3). The verb <i lang="xx">faduatsiete</i> is a type of several
verbs which end in <i lang="xx">ete</i>, preceded by the syllable
<i lang="xx">tsi</i>. All these appear to lose <i lang="xx">tsi</i> in
the future, although some have both forms.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">kiovatsiete</i>, to cry (of black parrot): fut.
<i lang="xx">kiovatatsi</i> and <i lang="xx">kiovatsitatsi</i>.<br>
<i lang="xx">puatsiete</i>, to make a cracking noise: fut. <i lang=
"xx">puatatsi</i> and <i lang="xx">puatsiatsi</i>.</p>
<p>(4). The verb <i lang="xx">sue</i> in the meaning &ldquo;go
away&rdquo; always has <i>ga</i>.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">nu ga sua? na ga sua</i>, are you going away? I am
going away.</p>
<p>The verb <i lang="xx">angege</i>, to go, in the past tense has the
particle ga prefixed to the verb instead of suffixed to the
pronoun.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">na nul etsi ganga</i>, I went to your village.</p>

<h4 class="main">XII. Notes on Some Verbs.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. <i lang="xx">Tede</i> and <i>i</i>.</p>
<p>There is a difference in the meaning of the verbs <i lang=
"xx">tede</i>, (<i>ete</i>) and <i>i</i>, both used for
&ldquo;do&rdquo; or &ldquo;make.&rdquo; The first is used when the
object by which one obtains the action is indicated, the second is used
when the action only is expressed, and might then be translated by the
phrase &ldquo;to go to work, to set about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">olon&rsquo;ete</i>, to snore, make a sound with the
<i lang="xx">olo</i>(<i lang="xx">ne</i> hole, <i>i.e.</i>, the
nostrils, <i lang="xx">ung&rsquo;ul &rsquo;olo. na (melauk&rsquo;) i
koitsi</i>, I shall do the thing wrong.</p>
<p>2. <i lang="xx">Gege, angege, engege, songe.</i></p>
<p>All of these have the general meaning of &ldquo;go.&rdquo; Their
differences are not yet clearly understood. <i lang="xx">Engege</i>
appears to mean &ldquo;go up.&rdquo; <i lang="xx">Songe</i> is
specially employed when the following phrase indicates a final
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e10722" href="#xd26e10722" name=
"xd26e10722">326</a>]</span>proposition, or an answer to the questions
&ldquo;Where do you come from?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Where are you
going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">nuni o&rsquo; gega</i>, thou hast passed down
there; <i lang="xx">di engo</i>, let us go up; <i lang="xx">na
song&rsquo; em&rsquo; aritsi</i>, I am going to see the village; <i>nu
do sona</i>? where have you been? (or, where do you come from?); <i>na
bulitsi sova</i>, I have been in the garden (or, I have come from the
garden).</p>
<p>3. <i lang="xx">Idede</i>.</p>
<p>This verb has a general meaning besides the special one &ldquo;to
gather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">fang&rsquo; idede</i>, to set a trap; <i lang=
"xx">di yu molots&rsquo; idoma</i>? should we make a water-pipe?</p>
<p>4. <i lang="xx">Ameme</i>.</p>
<p>This verb has the general meaning of passing, or making anything
pass, through an opening. The object which has the opening does not
take suffixes.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">kupa ulin&rsquo; ama</i>, put the potatoes in the
pot; <i lang="xx">na ul&rsquo; olol&rsquo; amene</i>, I passed it
through the hole; <i lang="xx">iso nu emana? andavete</i>, does the
smoke irritate you? you are weeping.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. All the postpositions are used as suffixes to the
words which they govern. When the noun to which they are suffixed has a
double form, the postposition is added to the short form.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">uli-tsi</i> from <i lang="xx">uli(ne)</i> pot:
<i lang="xx">fatsi</i> from <i lang="xx">fa(le)</i>, ground.</p>
<p>There are however some exceptions.</p>
<p>2. When the postposition begins with a consonant, the final <i>e</i>
of a noun changes to <i>i</i>.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">kodigi-tsi</i> from <i lang="xx">kodige</i>, plate;
<i lang="xx">bulitsi</i> from <i lang="xx">bule</i>, garden.</p>

<h3 class="main">Notes on Dependent Clauses.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. A final proposition with the future is expressed in
four ways.</p>
<p>a. By the infinitive preceding the verb which it governs: <i lang=
"xx">na nul&rsquo; em&rsquo; arim&rsquo; an gatsi</i>, I will go to see
thy village, lit, I thy village to-see will-go. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e11538" href="#xd26e11538" name=
"xd26e11538">331</a>]</span></p>
<p>b. By the simple future preceded by the verb: <i lang="xx">na songe,
Tsekari aritsi</i>, I go, I shall see Tseka.</p>
<p>c. By the future preceding the verb: <i lang="xx">ake Mambutsi
itatsi m&rsquo; ando</i>, the men remain to sleep at Mambo.</p>
<p>d. By the suffix <i lang="xx">-du(le): Pe&rsquo; Egidi yol&rsquo;
itadul andemai, puatsitatsi,</i> If P&egrave;re Egidi stays to sleep up
there, he will fire a gun; <i lang="xx">ake Baidane (gatsi) ame
boladu</i>, the men will go to Baidane to leave the girl; <i lang=
"xx">muto yetadu, Labao gatsi</i>; I will go to Yule Is to take the
sheep, (<i lang="xx">muto</i>, Fr. mouton). The use of the verb
&ldquo;to go&rdquo; is not certain.</p>
<p>2. A dependent sentence with the past is expressed in two ways.</p>
<p>a. By the simple past: <i lang="xx">na so, fang&rsquo; an</i>, I
went to see the trap.</p>
<p>b. By the suffix <i lang="xx">-ua</i>, with the omission of the
verb: <i lang="xx">Tsekan&rsquo; alilua</i>, I went to see Tseka, which
might also be translated: <i lang="xx">na sova, Tsekan&rsquo;
ari</i>.</p>
<p>3. Causative sentences appear to be governed by the same rules as
the preceding.</p>
<p>Ex. <i lang="xx">ame nu arim&rsquo; undede</i>, the girl is afraid
to see you; <i lang="xx">andal&rsquo; un&rsquo; arim&rsquo; ete</i>,
what has he seen to talk about.</p>
<p>4. Conditional sentences precede the principal and have their verb
in the subjunctive with the conjunction <i lang="xx">-mai</i> or
<i lang="xx">-tamai</i>. (See p. 330, III.).</p>
<p>5. A dependent sentence expressing time also precedes the principal
sentence. It has its verb in the subjunctive or indicative, followed by
the conjunction <i lang="xx">-ta</i> or sometimes <i lang=
"xx">-tamai</i>. (See p. 330, III.). <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">Note on the Afoa Language</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By Dr. W.&nbsp;M. Strong</p>
<p>The vocabulary recorded below was obtained from a Fuyuge native who
spoke the Afoa language. He had travelled with me to the Afoa-speaking
villages on Mount Pitsoko and I could assure myself that he spoke the
language fluently. In spite of the vocabulary having been obtained
through a Fuyuge native there is very little similarity between this
and the Fuyuge vocabulary. It should be noted that the words for
&ldquo;I&rdquo; and for &ldquo;thou&rdquo; are substantially the same
in the two languages.</p>
<p>I also obtained a short vocabulary from a native who came down the
coast to me, and found that this was substantially the same as the
Pitsoko vocabulary. The native had come from a village which appeared
to be situated on the slopes of Mount Davidson and on the inland side
of it. According to native accounts the Afoa language is spoken in
numerous villages which stretch from Mount Davidson to the head of the
St. Joseph River in the Mafulu district. All the Afoa villages are
situated north of the St. Joseph and its main branches.</p>

<p>Substantially the same language is spoken in the whole of the
neighbourhood of Mount Yule. I have travelled all around this mountain
and the same interpreter was able to make himself understood
everywhere. The vocabulary recorded below was collected by means of the
Motuan from a native of Lopiko in the Inava valley. I have also
collected short vocabularies from the village of Inavarene in the same
valley, and from the Kwoifa district of the upper part of the Lakekamu
river. These vocabularies show close similarities with that of Lopiko.
The natives around the Pic Eleia also speak much the same language.</p>
<p>The vocabulary of the language bears no resemblance to any other
language I am acquainted with. It is peculiar in that a word often ends
in a consonant preceded by a short vowel. There is also an unusual
consonant sound in the language. This sound seems to vary between a
&ldquo;ch&rdquo; and a &ldquo;tch&rdquo; sound.</p>

<p class="first">The grammars and vocabularies collected by the Rev.
Father Egedi, the Rev. E.&nbsp;P. Money and Dr. W.&nbsp;M. Strong
illustrate the languages spoken in the higher hill country extending
from the district about Mount Yule to Mount Albert Edward and the Upper
Vanapa River. They form three distinct groups.</p>
<p>1. Fuyuge, comprising the dialects of Mafulu, Kambisa, Korona and
Sikube.</p>
<p>2. Afoa or Ambo, including Tauata.</p>
<p>3. Kovio, including Oru Lopiko.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. Fuyuge:&mdash;The first specimen of any lanugage of
the Fuyuge group was collected by the Rev. James Chalmers in 1879. This
was called by him Kabana, and was printed in a collection of
vocabularies in 1888.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15456src" href=
"#xd26e15456" name="xd26e15456src">1</a> From a note on the original
MS., the vocabulary was assumed to be the dialect of a village on Mount
Victoria (called by Chalmers Mount Owen Stanley).<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e15461src" href="#xd26e15461" name="xd26e15461src">2</a> But as
Sir William MacGregor pointed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e15466"
href="#xd26e15466" name="xd26e15466">346</a>]</span>out,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e15468src" href="#xd26e15468" name=
"xd26e15468src">3</a> there are no villages on that mountain, hence
Chalmers, in assigning a locality to the vocabulary some time after its
collection, must have been mistaken. The language of Chalmers&rsquo;
Kabana is nearly the same as that of a vocabulary collected by Mr. A.
Giulianetti at the village of Sikube in the Upper Vetapa or Vanapa
valley, north of Mount Lilley. This was published in 1898.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e15473src" href="#xd26e15473" name=
"xd26e15473src">4</a></p>
<p>A few words from the village of Kambisa, in Sirima (Chirima) valley
were published in the Annual Report on British New Guinea for
1905&ndash;6,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e15480src" href="#xd26e15480"
name="xd26e15480src">5</a> and I have since been favoured by the
compiler, the Rev. P.&nbsp;J. Money, with a fuller list. The Rev.
Father Egedi published in 1907 a vocabulary of Fuyuge along with his
account of the Tauata or Afoa tribe.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e15485src" href="#xd26e15485" name="xd26e15485src">6</a> Dr.
Strong collected a vocabulary from the natives of Korona, a village
situated close to the head of Galley Reach. This was collected with the
help of a Motu-speaking native, and contains a few apparently
Melanesian words. Dr. Strong was spontaneously told that these had been
introduced from the coast in quite recent times. (<i>Cf</i>. &sect;
III.)</p>
<p>The words in the comparative vocabulary are taken from an extensive
collection in Mafulu by the Rev. Father Egedi. They represent the same
dialect as the Grammar in <a href="#app1">Appendix I</a>.</p>
<p>That Mafulu, Kambisa, and Korona, with Sikube and Kabana, represent
the same language is plain.</p>
<p>The Kabana pronoun <i>nahu</i>, I, the Sikube <i>na(nio</i>) I,
<i>nu</i>(<i>ni</i>) thou, and the Kambisa <i>na</i>, I, <i>nu</i>,
thou, <i>hu</i>, he, agree with the Fuyuge <i>na, na(ni</i>), I, <i>nu,
nu(ni</i>) thou, <i>u</i>, he. The Kabana <i>nauera</i>, mine, is the
Fuyuge <i>naula</i>. The Kambisa <i>nara-ndo</i>, mine,
<i>nura-ndo</i>, thine, <i>hura-ndo</i> his, also show a suffix
<i>ndo</i> corresponding to Mafulu <i>ne</i> in <i>naula(ne</i>), mine,
<i>nula(ne</i>) thine, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e15562" href=
"#xd26e15562" name="xd26e15562">347</a>]</span><i>ula(ne</i>) his, and
in the vocabulary the Kambisa suffix <i>nda</i> corresponds to the
Korona <i>de</i> in the word for &ldquo;chest.&rdquo; There is,
however, no evidence that the Korona <i>de</i> is equivalent to the
Mafulu <i>ne</i>. The word given in Sikube for &ldquo;woman,&rdquo;
<i>amuri</i>, is the Fuyuge plural <i>amuli</i>,
&ldquo;women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few other likenesses appear, as <i>e.g.</i>, Kambisa suffix
<i>ng</i> represents Mafulu <i>me, ne</i>; Kambisa <i>fa</i>, the
Fuyuge <i>ve</i>; Kambisa <i>a</i>, Korona <i>la</i>, Mafulu
<i>le</i>.</p>
<p>The following extract shows the likeness of the vocabulary.<a class=

<p>The numerals show similar agreements. These will be illustrated in
the next section.</p>
<p>2. Afoa.&mdash;The Afoa vocabulary was collected by Dr. Strong in
the villages on Mount Pitsoko from a Fuyuge native who spoke Afoa
fluently. Dr. Strong also obtained a short vocabulary from a native who
came from a village apparently on the slopes of Mount Davidson. The
language is substantially the same as the Tauata or Tauatape of which
Rev. Father Egedi has published a Vocabulary and Grammar.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e16121src" href="#xd26e16121" name=
"xd26e16121src">8</a> There are, however, a few slight differences
which seem to confirm Father Egedi&rsquo;s statement that there is
probably a difference of pronunciation in the various Afoa
villages.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e16129src" href="#xd26e16129" name=
"xd26e16129src">9</a> Father Egedi writes: <i>p, v, k, t, l, ts</i>
where Dr. Strong has: <i>b, w, g, d, r, t</i>. The latter also has
final <i>i</i> for <i>e</i>, <i>&#333;&#257;</i> for <i>a</i> or
<i>o</i>, <i>ia</i> for <i>ea</i>, <i>u</i> for <i>oi</i> <i>ai</i> for
<i>ei</i>. Sometimes <i>b</i> represents <i>m</i> or <i>v</i>. Some of
Dr. Strong&rsquo;s words show marks of Afoa grammar, as, <i>e.g.</i>,
the words for eat, see, sit, give, head, husband or wife, mother, are:
<i lang="xx">na nai</i>, I eat; <i lang="xx">na nu kava</i>, I thee
see; <i lang="xx">na navi</i>, I sit; <i lang="xx">nu inie</i>, thou
givest; <i lang="xx">ni adi</i>, your head; <i lang="xx">omen iva</i>,
his wife or her husband; <i lang="xx">aumen ini</i>, his mother. The
Tauata words are added to the Afoa Vocabulary in square brackets.</p>
<p>3. Kovio.&mdash;The language called Kovio by Dr. Strong is
substantially the same as the Oru Lopiko of Rev. Father Egedi.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e16212src" href="#xd26e16212" name=
"xd26e16212src">10</a> The same or a similar language is said to be

<p>It is interesting here to note the agreement in the forms of the
first and second persons singular, with a wide difference in the other
pronouns. Similar words for these two pronouns occur in other Papuan
languages as <i>e.g.</i>, Kai (Finschhafen) <i>no</i>, Kelana Kai
<i>nai</i>, &ldquo;I,&rdquo; and Bongu and Bogadjim (Astrolabe Bay),
<i>ni</i>, Kelana Kai <i>ne</i>, &ldquo;thou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widespread use of a suffix, used when the pronoun is emphatic,
is noteworthy. The possessive case also is formed as in some other
Papuan languages by a suffix added to the root of the pronoun.

<p>Sometimes the simple form of the pronoun is prefixed to the noun in

<p>Some of these words have other meanings. Thus Fuyuge 2,

It is, therefore, of some importance to note whether any apparently
non-Melanesian elements in these languages may be traced to the
influence of the neighbouring Papuan tongues.</p>

the preceding of the substantive by the genitive, but in the

<p>But there are many apparently non-Melanesian words in Mekeo, Kuni
and Pokau, which are different in each language, and cannot be traced
to the neighbouring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e17372" href=
"#xd26e17372" name="xd26e17372">352</a>]</span>Papuan. The inference is
that such words may be remnants of other Papuan tongues spoken in the
St. Joseph and Aroa Basins, which have been absorbed by the immigrant
Melanesian speech.</p>
<p>Only three Melanesian words in the list appear to have been adopted
by the Papuans. These are: Tauata <i>nau</i> (<i>pe</i>), earthen dish,
which is Kuni, Motu, Pokau, &amp;c., <i>nau</i>; Fuyuge asi boat, Pokau
and Motu asi; and Fuyuge <i>bara</i>, paddle, the Motu, Kabadi
<i>bara</i>, Mekeo <i>fanga</i>, oar. The Fuyuge <i>kokole</i> fowl is
also probably the Mekeo <i>kokolo</i>.</p>
